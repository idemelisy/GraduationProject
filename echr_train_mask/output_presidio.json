    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36244/06) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Danish national, Mr Henrik Hasslund (“the applicant”), on 31 August 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Tyge Trier, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Nina Holst-Christensen of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn 5 September 2007 the Acting President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Les Salles Sur Verdon, France.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s a new concept called “tax asset stripping cases” (selskabstømmersager) came into existence in Denmark. It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive, solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for the sake of their own profit, “stripping” the companies of assets, including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated in their economic criminal activities, which concerned very large amounts of money. According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities, approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner (DKK) were stripped in the period from the late 1980s until 1994. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive, solvent companies largely ceased in the summer of 1993.\n\nIn 1994, the applicant learnt via a local newspaper that he was the subject of an investigation, as was a private limited stockbrokers company, of which he was part owner.\n\nBy letter of 9 June 1994 he informed the police that he was available for an interview, if required. By letter of 14 June 1994 the police confirmed that they were in the process of investigation and informed the applicant that they would talk to him at a later stage.\n\nFrom November 1994 to September 1995, six discovery orders were issued against two banks, four search warrants were issued and numerous interviews were held.\n\nOn 19 September 1995 the applicant was arrested and charged, inter alia, with aggravated debtor fraud. On the same day he was detained in solitary confinement, which was prolonged at regular intervals until he was released on 22 December 1995.\n\nOn the latter date, an oral hearing took place before the Copenhagen City Court (Københavns Byret - hereafter “the City Court”), during which the prosecution stated that the investigation was concluded and that the indictment could be expected at the beginning of 1996.\n\nFrom January 1996 to June 1998 various investigative steps were taken, notably relating to five co-accused in the case, for example searches in Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden, numerous interviews in Denmark and abroad, international letters of request, a request to Interpol, fifteen discovery orders and an order prohibiting the disclosure of the applicant’s name. Moreover, on 19 March 1997 a request for an accountant’s report was made and material for that purpose was obtained, including statements of account, cheque vouchers and so on.\n\nOn 25 June 1998, the indictment was submitted to the City Court according to which the applicant (and five co-accused: A, B, N, M and R) were charged of “tax asset stripping” committed jointly. The applicant was charged with fifteen counts out of a total of fifty-nine committed between March 1992 and May 1993. His responsibility related to an amount of DKK 9,890,000 (approximately 1,300,000 euros (EUR)) out of the total amount of tax evaded in the case which came to approximately EUR 19,000,000.\n\nBetween 14 August 1998 and 10 March 1999, fifteen pre-trial hearings were held and the draft of the accountant’s reports was submitted. On the former date, the case was set down for trial on 15 March 1999.\n\nBetween 15 March 1999 and 31 January 2001, a total of 119 hearings were held. The applicant, the five co-accused and more than seventy witnesses were heard, including state-registered public accountants. Statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were also produced. The court records comprised 1,330 pages. The closing speeches were held over ten days in November 2000 and January 2001.\n\nBy a judgment of 6 April 2001, which ran to 220 pages, the City Court convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment, but on one count he was acquitted. The co-accused were also convicted. The applicant was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. In addition, an amount of DKK 2,200,000 was seized, and he was deprived for an indefinite period of his right to establish a private limited company or a company or an association requiring public approval, or to become a manager and/or member of a director’s board of such companies.\n\nThe City Court dismissed the applicant’s claim that the length of the proceedings had been at variance with Article 6 of the Convention, stating the following: “The City Court finds no reason to criticise the prosecution’s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the [applicant and the five co‑accused]. Accordingly, and having regard to the mutual connection between the cases and their character, the City Court finds no violation of Article 6 of the Convention, although there were longer periods of inactivity during one part of the case, while investigation was going on in another part of the case. In this connection [the City Court] notes that the complexity of the acts carried out by [the applicant and the five co-accused] partly when buying and “stripping” the companies for assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. In the City Court’s opinion there were no longer periods, whether before the police, the prosecution or the City Court, during which no part of the case proceeded. It must be emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against [M] and [the co-accused B and R] could not proceed before the cases against [the applicant, N and A] [had been heard]. [Finally], in view of the character and complexity of the case, [the City Court] considers that the total length of the proceedings did not in itself constitute a breach of the said provision of the Convention.”\n\nOn 15 May 2001 the applicant and the five co-accused appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret - “the High Court”).\n\nAfter that date, twelve preparatory hearings were held, including one on 13 September 2001 during which the trial was scheduled with numerous fixed dates to commence on 24 September 2002. Counsel for the applicant and the co-defendants jointly replied that they only had very limited possibilities to appear during the autumn of 2002.\n\nThus, although the trial commenced on 24 September 2002, most of the hearings took place in 2003 and 2004. A total of about 90 hearings were held in the case. In February and March 2004 the appeal hearings had to be postponed because the applicant fell ill. For the same reason the High Court changed the order of some of the hearings. The Court records comprised 861 pages. The closing speeches were held over ten days in April, May, and June 2004.\n\nOn 28 September 2004 the High Court upheld the City Court’s judgment. As regards the length of the proceedings, it stated: “In the assessment of whether the proceedings have been concluded within a reasonable time, the starting point ... concerning the [applicant] was on 19 September 1995, when he was charged ... [The High Court] upholds the City Court’s judgment and its reasoning with regard to the question of whether Article 6 of the Convention has been violated ... The appeal proceedings were scheduled and carried out without any unreasonable delay. On 13 September 2001 the trial was scheduled to take place on fixed dates as from 12 August 2002. A number of hearing dates in the autumn 2002 and the beginning of 2003 had to be cancelled because some counsel were occupied [with other cases], for which reason the [present] case was delayed. To avoid any further delay caused by impossibilities to appear, the trial, which commenced on 24 September 2002, proceeded in a proper, but not completely suitable order.”\n\nIn the period from 7 to 12 October 2004, the applicant and the co‑defendants requested that the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) grant them leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret). Three of the defendants stated in their petitions that they would submit supplementary comments, which were received on 17 December 2004. In January 2005 the cases were sent to the prosecution, which gave its opinion on 29 March 2005. The applicant and the co‑defendants gave their comments in reply and at a meeting on 5 August 2005 the Leave to Appeal Board decided to refuse the requests. Letters of refusal were not sent out, however, as on 9 August 2005 counsel for one of the co-defendants stated that he wanted to submit supplementary comments in the light of a recent judgment in a similar case.\n\nThereafter, due to an error, nothing happened in the case until 2 May 2006, when the police telephoned the Leave to Appeal Board and drew attention to the case. Subsequently, on his request, counsel for the relevant co-defendant who had wanted to submit supplementary comments did so on 2 and 13 June 2006. The applicant and the co-defendant were informed on 21 June 2006 that their requests for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court had been refused.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36244/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON] of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Acting President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nAt [DATE_TIME] a new concept called “tax asset stripping cases” (selskabstømmersager) came into existence in [LOCATION]. It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive, solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for the sake of their own profit, “stripping” the companies of assets, including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated in their economic criminal activities, which concerned very large amounts of money. According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities, approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner (DKK) were stripped in the period from [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME]. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive, solvent companies largely ceased in [DATE_TIME].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME], the applicant learnt via a local newspaper that he was the subject of an investigation, as was a private limited stockbrokers company, of which he was part owner.\n\nBy letter of [DATE_TIME] he informed the police that he was available for an interview, if required. By letter of [DATE_TIME] the police confirmed that they were in the process of investigation and informed the applicant that they would talk to him at a later stage.\n\nFrom [DATE_TIME], six discovery orders were issued against two banks, four search warrants were issued and numerous interviews were held.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and charged, inter alia, with aggravated debtor fraud. On [DATE_TIME] he was detained in solitary confinement, which was prolonged at regular intervals until he was released on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], an oral hearing took place before the Copenhagen City Court ([PERSON] hereafter “the City Court”), during which the prosecution stated that the investigation was concluded and that the indictment could be expected at [DATE_TIME].\n\nFrom [DATE_TIME] various investigative steps were taken, notably relating to five co-accused in the case, for example searches in [LOCATION], [LOCATION] and [LOCATION], numerous interviews in [LOCATION] and abroad, international letters of request, a request to Interpol, fifteen discovery orders and an order prohibiting the disclosure of the applicant’s name. Moreover, on [DATE_TIME] a request for an accountant’s report was made and material for that purpose was obtained, including statements of account, cheque vouchers and so on.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the indictment was submitted to the City Court according to which the applicant (and five co-accused: A, B, N, M and R) were charged of “tax asset stripping” committed jointly. The applicant was charged with fifteen counts out of a total of fifty-nine committed between [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. His responsibility related to an amount of DKK 9,890,000 (approximately 1,300,000 euros (EUR)) out of the total amount of tax evaded in the case which came to approximately EUR 19,000,000.\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], fifteen pre-trial hearings were held and the draft of the accountant’s reports was submitted. On the former date, the case was set down for trial on [DATE_TIME].\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], a total of 119 hearings were held. The applicant, the five co-accused and more than seventy witnesses were heard, including state-registered public accountants. Statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were also produced. The court records comprised 1,330 pages. The closing speeches were held over [DATE_TIME] in [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nBy a judgment of [DATE_TIME], which ran to 220 pages, the City Court convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment, but on one count he was acquitted. The co-accused were also convicted. The applicant was sentenced to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment. In addition, an amount of DKK 2,200,000 was seized, and he was deprived for an indefinite period of his right to establish a private limited company or a company or an association requiring public approval, or to become a manager and/or member of a director’s board of such companies.\n\nThe City Court dismissed the applicant’s claim that the length of the proceedings had been at variance with Article 6 of the Convention, stating the following: “The City Court finds no reason to criticise the prosecution’s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the [applicant and the five co‑accused]. Accordingly, and having regard to the mutual connection between the cases and their character, the City Court finds no violation of Article 6 of the Convention, although there were longer periods of inactivity during one part of the case, while investigation was going on in another part of the case. In this connection [the City Court] notes that the complexity of the acts carried out by [the applicant and the five co-accused] partly when buying and “stripping” the companies for assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. In the City Court’s opinion there were no longer periods, whether before the police, the prosecution or the City Court, during which no part of the case proceeded. It must be emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against [M] and [the co-accused B and R] could not proceed before the cases against [the applicant, N and A] [had been heard]. [Finally], in view of the character and complexity of the case, [the City Court] considers that the total length of the proceedings did not in itself constitute a breach of the said provision of the Convention.”\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant and the five co-accused appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Eastern Denmark ([PERSON] - “the High Court”).\n\nAfter that date, twelve preparatory hearings were held, including one on [DATE_TIME] during which the trial was scheduled with numerous fixed dates to commence on [DATE_TIME]. Counsel for the applicant and the co-defendants jointly replied that they only had very limited possibilities to appear during [DATE_TIME].\n\nThus, although the trial commenced on [DATE_TIME], most of the hearings took place in [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. A total of about 90 hearings were held in the case. In [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the appeal hearings had to be postponed because the applicant fell ill. For the same reason the High Court changed the order of some of the hearings. The Court records comprised 861 pages. The closing speeches were held over [DATE_TIME] in [DATE_TIME], and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the High Court upheld the City Court’s judgment. As regards the length of the proceedings, it stated: “In the assessment of whether the proceedings have been concluded within a reasonable time, the starting point ... concerning the [applicant] was on [DATE_TIME], when he was charged ... [The High Court] upholds the City Court’s judgment and its reasoning with regard to the question of whether Article 6 of the Convention has been violated ... The appeal proceedings were scheduled and carried out without any unreasonable delay. On [DATE_TIME] the trial was scheduled to take place on fixed dates as from [DATE_TIME]. A number of hearing dates in the [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] had to be cancelled because some counsel were occupied [with other cases], for which reason the [present] case was delayed. To avoid any further delay caused by impossibilities to appear, the trial, which commenced on [DATE_TIME], proceeded in a proper, but not completely suitable order.”\n\nIn the period from [DATE_TIME], the applicant and the co‑defendants requested that the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) grant them leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret). Three of the defendants stated in their petitions that they would submit supplementary comments, which were received on [DATE_TIME]. In [DATE_TIME] the cases were sent to the prosecution, which gave its opinion on [DATE_TIME]. The applicant and the co‑defendants gave their comments in reply and at a meeting on [DATE_TIME] the Leave to Appeal Board decided to refuse the requests. Letters of refusal were not sent out, however, as on [DATE_TIME] counsel for one of the co-defendants stated that he wanted to submit supplementary comments in the light of a recent judgment in a similar case.\n\nThereafter, due to an error, nothing happened in the case until [DATE_TIME], when the police telephoned the Leave to Appeal Board and drew attention to the case. Subsequently, on his request, counsel for the relevant co-defendant who had wanted to submit supplementary comments did so on [DATE_TIME]. The applicant and the co-defendant were informed on [DATE_TIME] that their requests for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court had been refused.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29366/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr D. Stępniak on 25 July 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 5 January 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Bytom.\n\n1. The applicant's detention\n\nOn 21 October 2002 the applicant was arrested. By a decision of 24 October 2002 the District Court in Wodzisław Śląski remanded him in custody on charges connected with organised crime. It had regard to evidence gathered by the prosecuting authorities which indicated that the applicant had committed the offences concerned. The applicant appealed, to no avail.\n\nThe same court subsequently extended the applicant's detention by decisions of, inter alia, 10 July and 7 October 2003 and 7 March 2004, until, respectively, 15 October 2003, 19 January and 19 July 2004. The court relied on the evidence gathered in the case which pointed to the likelihood of the applicant's guilt. It was also of the view that the applicant, if released, could hinder the proper course of the investigations and judicial proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses and by colluding with his co-accused. It noted that many persons appeared to have been involved in the commission of the offences concerned and that it was therefore necessary to obtain a considerable amount of evidence. It also had regard to the applicant's criminal record.\n\nOn numerous other occasions the prosecuting authorities refused to release the applicant, relying on the same arguments and referring to the evidence gathered in the investigation.\n\nOn an unspecified number of occasions the applicant was allowed to see his wife during his detention. Between 15 December 2002, the date on which the applicant's wife gave birth to a son, and 21 November 2003 the applicant saw her and his son on at least three occasions.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 the prosecuting authorities lodged a bill of indictment with the Wodzislaw Śląski District Court. The applicant was charged with multiple counts of fraud.\n\nOn 11 December 2003 the court ordered that the applicant should serve a prison sentence imposed on him by a final judgment given in another criminal case concurrently with the present detention.\n\nHearings in the case were held on 7 January, 18 February and 25 October 2004. On the latter date the applicant was convicted as charged.\n\n2. Censorship of the applicant's correspondence\n\nThe applicant submitted envelopes of two letters sent to him by the Court on 15 January 2004 and 30 March 2004. The envelope of the first letter bears the stamp “Censored (cenzurowano) – the Wodzisław Śląski District Court – Date”, signed with an illegible signature. The envelope of the second letter bears the full official stamp of the Wodzisław Śląski District Court and a handwritten note “censorship” (cenzura), accompanied by a handwritten date, 9 April 2004.",

Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\n1. The applicant's detention\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested. By a decision of [DATE_TIME] the District Court in [PERSON] remanded him in custody on charges connected with organised crime. It had regard to evidence gathered by the prosecuting authorities which indicated that the applicant had committed the offences concerned. The applicant appealed, to no avail.\n\nThe same court subsequently extended the applicant's detention by decisions of, inter alia, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], until, respectively, [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME]. The court relied on the evidence gathered in the case which pointed to the likelihood of the applicant's guilt. It was also of the view that the applicant, if released, could hinder the proper course of the investigations and judicial proceedings by exerting pressure on witnesses and by colluding with his co-accused. It noted that many persons appeared to have been involved in the commission of the offences concerned and that it was therefore necessary to obtain a considerable amount of evidence. It also had regard to the applicant's criminal record.\n\nOn numerous other occasions the prosecuting authorities refused to release the applicant, relying on the same arguments and referring to the evidence gathered in the investigation.\n\nOn an unspecified number of occasions the applicant was allowed to see his wife during his detention. [DATE_TIME], the date on which the applicant's wife gave birth to a son, and [DATE_TIME] the applicant saw her and his son on at least three occasions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the prosecuting authorities lodged a bill of indictment with the Wodzislaw Śląski District Court. The applicant was charged with multiple counts of fraud.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ordered that the applicant should serve a prison sentence imposed on him by a final judgment given in another criminal case concurrently with the present detention.\n\nHearings in the case were held on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. On the latter date the applicant was convicted as charged.\n\n2. Censorship of the applicant's correspondence\n\nThe applicant submitted envelopes of two letters sent to him by the Court on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The envelope of the first letter bears the stamp “Censored (cenzurowano) – [LOCATION] – Date”, signed with an illegible signature. The envelope of the second letter bears the full official stamp of the Wodzisław Śląski District Court and a handwritten note “censorship” (cenzura), accompanied by a handwritten date, [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 5138/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Nusret Amutgan (“the applicant”), on 29 December 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms B Özpolat, a lawyer practising in Gaziantep. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 4 January 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1970 and is serving his prison sentence in the Gaziantep H-type Prison.\n\nOn 27 April 1998 the applicant was taken into custody during a military operation carried out by the Turkish armed forces on suspicion of being a member of an illegal armed organisation, namely the PKK (the Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). The applicant was detained at a gendarme station, where he was questioned in the absence of a lawyer and his detailed statement was recorded verbatim.\n\nIn the statement the applicant was quoted as having said that he had joined the PKK on 13 February 1995 and that he had carried out a number of armed activities since that date.\n\nOn 6 May 1998 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge. When questioned by the prosecutor and the judge, in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant confirmed the accuracy of the information contained in the statement he had made at the gendarme station, and repeated that he had carried out a number of armed activities. The applicant was placed in detention on remand on the order of the investigating judge.\n\nOn 15 June 1998 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed an indictment, charging the applicant with the offence of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory. He sought the death penalty under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe trial of the applicant and his seven co-defendants began on 20 August 1998 before the Diyarbakır State Security Court. In the course of the trial, the applicant was represented by his lawyer. He informed the court that he had joined the PKK in 1995 and had received military training. He further admitted to certain charges brought against him. The applicant also stated, during the hearings, that he had been forced to put his thumbprint on the statement taken from him at the gendarme station.\n\nOn 28 November 2002 the Diyarbakır State Security Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. The death penalty was commuted to a life sentence. The court found it established, on the basis of, inter alia, the statements taken from the applicant after his arrest and the testimony given by him during the trial, that he had carried out a number of illegal activities and had been involved in the killing and kidnapping of a number of village guards.\n\nOn 16 September 2003 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal.",

In the course of the trial, the applicant was represented by his lawyer. He informed the court that he had joined the PKK in [DATE_TIME] and had received military training. He further admitted to certain charges brought against him. The applicant also stated, during the hearings, that he had been forced to put his thumbprint on the statement taken from him at the gendarme station.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Diyarbakır State Security Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. The death penalty was commuted to a life sentence. The court found it established, on the basis of, inter alia, the statements taken from the applicant after his arrest and the testimony given by him during the trial, that he had carried out a number of illegal activities and had been involved in the killing and kidnapping of a number of village guards.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 42596/98 and 42603/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Mustafa Sarı and Ms Sibel Çolak (“the applicants”), on 3 April 1998.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mrs E. Çıtak, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not appoint an agent to represent them before the Court.\n\nOn 1 February 2000 the First Section decided to join the applications, to declare them partly inadmissible and to give the Government notice of the complaints under Article 5 §§ 1 and 3 and Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 and 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1 of the Rules of Court). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits of the case (Rule 59 § 1). The parties replied in writing to each other’s observations.\n\nApplying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, the Court decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, Mr Sarı and Ms Çolak, were born in 1973 and 1977 respectively. At the material time they lived in Ankara.\n\nOn 17 November 1997, at 11.45 p.m., the applicants were arrested and taken into police custody by officers of the Ankara security police in connection with an investigation into the illegal organisation THKP-C Dev Yol – Devrim Hareketi (Turkish People’s Liberation Party-Front – Revolutionary Way – Revolutionary Movement).\n\nThe applicants’ detention in police custody was extended, under section 16 of Law no. 2845 (see paragraph 17 below), initially until 21 November 1997, on the authorisation of the public prosecutor at the Ankara National Security Court, and subsequently until 23 November 1997 (inclusive) by order of a judge of that court.\n\nBefore the end of their police custody period, on 23 November 1997 at 11.45 p.m., the applicants were questioned by the public prosecutor. They were not brought before a judge until the following morning, that is to say on 24 November 1997. The judge ordered Ms Çolak to be released for the duration of the proceedings and remanded Mr Sarı in custody.\n\nBy a bill of indictment of 8 December 1997, the public prosecutor committed the applicants to stand trial before the National Security Court. He called for their conviction, under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code, on a charge of belonging to an armed gang.\n\nFollowing a hearing on 9 June 1998 before a trial court, Mr Sarı was granted provisional release.\n\nIn a judgment of 22 April 1999, after reclassifying the offence, the National Security Court found the applicants guilty of aiding and abetting an armed gang, an offence punishable under Article 169 of the Criminal Code. It sentenced them to three years and nine months’ imprisonment each, and banned them from holding public office for three years.\n\nThe applicants appealed on points of law against that judgment.\n\nIn a judgment of 23 February 2000, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment on account of an erroneous classification of the offence.\n\nThe National Security Court, in a judgment of 7 November 2001, deferred its decision on the applicants’ case.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29869/13) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Karwowski (“the applicant”), on 19 March 2013.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime on him and its lengthy application amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 July 2014 the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and is currently in detention in Warsaw.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 17 January 2006 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. He was suspected of the murder of two people and of inciting the murder of another person who had intended to testify against him in a separate set of proceedings.\n\nHe was subsequently convicted several times for various offences. In particular, on 27 February 2013 the Warsaw Regional Court convicted him of murder.\n\nB. Imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn 19 January 2006 the Warsaw Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a dangerous detainee. The decision stated as follows: “The commission hereby decides that [the applicant] is to be placed in a designated wing or cell in a remand centre in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre. The commission approves the proposals of the directors of the protection and prison wings. The detainee has been informed of his right to appeal against the commission’s decision within seven days to the Warsaw Regional Court, XI Penitentiary Division.” The last sentence of the decision contained information about who was to be informed about the applicant’s placement in a cell for dangerous detainees.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nThe commission reviewed and upheld its decision to classify the applicant as a dangerous detainee on several occasions. In total, there were over thirty decisions to extend the period of imposition of the regime in respect of the applicant. All the decisions were based on the same pattern of wording, which read as follows: “The commission has decided to extend [the applicant’s categorisation as a dangerous detainee] as the reasons for his placement in a cell in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre have not ceased to exist.”\n\nIn particular, a decision of 3 January 2013 to extend the imposition of the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and his highly deficient moral character.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant against the latter decision was the only one he made against the series of decisions to impose and extend the dangerous detainee regime on him.\n\nOn 30 January 2013 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn 21 November 2013 the commission lifted the dangerous detainee regime applied to the applicant.\n\nC. Specific aspects of the regime\n\nThe applicant was kept in a cell which was constantly monitored via closed‑circuit television. He was subjected to a body search every time he left or entered the cell, which meant in practice that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29869/13) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime on him and its lengthy application amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and is currently in detention in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. He was suspected of the murder of two people and of inciting the murder of another person who had intended to testify against him in a separate set of proceedings.\n\nHe was subsequently convicted several times for various offences. In particular, on [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court convicted him of murder.\n\nB. Imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a dangerous detainee. The decision stated as follows: “The commission hereby decides that [the applicant] is to be placed in a designated wing or cell in a remand centre in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre. The commission approves the proposals of the directors of the protection and prison wings. The detainee has been informed of his right to appeal against the commission’s decision within [DATE_TIME] to the Warsaw Regional Court, XI Penitentiary Division.” The last sentence of the decision contained information about who was to be informed about the applicant’s placement in a cell for dangerous detainees.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nThe commission reviewed and upheld its decision to classify the applicant as a dangerous detainee on several occasions. In total, there were over thirty decisions to extend the period of imposition of the regime in respect of the applicant. All the decisions were based on the same pattern of wording, which read as follows: “The commission has decided to extend [the applicant’s categorisation as a dangerous detainee] as the reasons for his placement in a cell in conditions which provide increased protection for society and for the security of the remand centre have not ceased to exist.”\n\nIn particular, a decision of [DATE_TIME] to extend the imposition of the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant referred to the seriousness of the charges against him and his highly deficient moral character.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant against the latter decision was the only one he made against the series of decisions to impose and extend the dangerous detainee regime on him.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the commission lifted the dangerous detainee regime applied to the applicant.\n\nC. Specific aspects of the regime\n\nThe applicant was kept in a cell which was constantly monitored via closed‑circuit television. He was subjected to a body search every time he left or entered the cell, which meant in practice that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38007/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Artur Warsiński (“the applicant”), on 3 October 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 November 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the issue of the possible monitoring of the applicant's correspondence. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nThe applicant, Mr Artur Warsiński, is a Polish national who was born in 1976 and lives in Bytów.\n\nThe applicant was charged with drug trafficking and detained on remand from 6 April 2002 to 21 May 2004. He was detained in the Słupsk Detention Centre.\n\nOn 28 May 2003 the Słupsk Regional Court found the applicant guilty of drug trafficking and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 30 December 2003 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal amended the judgment and sentenced the applicant to two years and four months' imprisonment. The judgment is final.\n\nB. The monitoring of the applicant's correspondence\n\nOn 3 October 2002 the applicant sent a letter to the European Court of Human Rights. It was received by the Court on 21 October 2002. It bears a stamp “censored on” (cenzurowano dnia ...), a handwritten date “2 October” and an illegible signature. The envelope also bears a stamp of the Słupsk Regional Court.\n\nOn 4 December 2002 the applicant sent another letter to the European Court of Human Rights. It was received by the Court on 17 December 2002. It bears a stamp “censored on”, a handwritten date “4 December” and an illegible signature. The envelope also bears a stamp of the Słupsk Regional Court.\n\nIt also appears that both envelopes had been cut open and resealed with adhesive tape.\n\nThe applicant submitted a photocopy of an envelope sent to him on 24 October 2002 by the Court. It bears a stamp “censored on”, a handwritten date “31 October 2002” and an illegible signature. The envelope also bears a stamp of the Słupsk Regional Court. The applicant claimed that he had received the letter in an opened envelope.\n\nThe applicant also produced a photocopy of an envelope sent to him on 22 November 2002 by “Amnesty International”. It bears a stamp “censored”, a handwritten date “28 November 2002” and an illegible signature. The envelope also bears a stamp of the Słupsk Detention Centre, with a date of receipt (25 November 2002) and a stamp of the Słupsk Regional Court.\n\nLastly, the applicant submitted a photocopy of an envelope sent to him on 28 November 2002 by “Transparency International - Polska”. It bears a stamp “censored”, a handwritten date “3 December” and an illegible signature. The envelope also bears a stamp of the Słupsk Detention Centre, with a date of receipt (2 December 2002) and a stamp of the Słupsk Regional Court.\n\nOn 12 June 2003 the applicant sent a letter to the Słupsk Regional Court in which he complained about censorship of his correspondence.\n\nOn 30 June 2003 he received a letter from the President of the Słupsk Regional Court informing him that, according to the information obtained from the Criminal Department of the Słupsk Regional Court, the applicant's correspondence had not been censored. He further stated that the applicant's correspondence had been stamped “censored” by mistake.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 64204/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Polish nationals, Mr Włodzimierz Majewski (“the first applicant”), Mr Włodzimierz Strzelczyk (“the second applicant”) and Mr Kazimierz Gniłka (“the third applicant”), on 15 September 2000\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and subsequently, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 16 June 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first and the third applicants were born in 1946 and 1959 respectively, they both live in Bełchatów. The second applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Szczerców.\n\nOn 17 March 1989 the applicants filed with the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) an action for payment against the Bełchatow Coal Mine in Rogowiec. On 17 November 1989 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court gave judgment. Both parties to the proceedings appealed.\n\nOn 7 March 1991 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) quashed the contested judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 7 June 1993 an expert submitted his opinion to the court. The court held hearings on the following dates: 16 September 1993, 28 June 1994 and 28 July 1994.\n\nOn 11 August 1994 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court gave judgment. Both parties to the proceedings appealed.\n\nOn 24 March 1995 the Łódź Court of Appeal quashed the contested judgment and referred the case to the lower instance for reconsideration.\n\nOn 22 February, 26 September, 5 November, 10 December 1996 and 3 June 1997 the Regional Court held hearings.\n\nOn 11 June 1997 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court gave judgment. The applicants appealed.\n\nOn 17 December 1997 the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) amended the contested judgment and ordered the company B to pay a higher amount of compensation to the applicants. On 11 February 1999 the applicants lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment with the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 2 September 1999 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants’ cassation appeal as unsubstantiated. On 16 March 2000 the Supreme Court, at the defendant’s lawyer’s request, amended the judgment of 2 September 1999 and ordered the applicants to pay the cassation fees. The decision was served on the applicants on 20 March 2000.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 27225/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mr İlhami Erseven, Mr Hikmet Yıldırım, Mr Veli Ateş, Mr İsmail Öztorun, Mr Ellez Duman, Mr İsmail Kaya, Mr Kenan Atakul, Mr Süleyman Çetinkaya and Mr Bekir Arslan (“the applicants”), on 22 April 2002.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr Fevzi Gümüş, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 13 June 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged breach of the applicants' right to a fair hearing to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, who were born in 1954, 1957, 1961, 1965, 1960, 1956, 1959, 1964 and 1958 respectively, live in Ankara, Izmir, Istanbul and Çorum. They were members of the executive and auditors boards of the Pir Sultan Abdal Cultural Association (“the Association”), a non‑governmental organisation with its headquarters in Ankara.\n\nOn 15 November 2000 officers from the Ankara governor's office carried out an inspection at the headquarters of the Association. They found that the members of the executive board had failed to establish a membership registration book and that the members of the auditors board had failed to conduct a periodical inspection of the Association, in breach of Articles 62 and 29 of the Law on Associations (Law no. 2908).\n\nOn 21 November 2000 officers from the Ankara Security Directorate also conducted an inspection of the registers of the association and discovered a number of defects. The Security Directorate then requested an investigation against the members of the executive and auditors boards of the association.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the Ankara public prosecutor imposed a fine of 92,510,0000 Turkish Liras (TRL) per person on the members of the executive and auditors boards of the Association.\n\nOn 15 January 2001 a payment order was served on the members of the executive and auditors boards who, however, did not pay the fine within the statutory ten-day time-limit.\n\nSubsequently, on 17 April 2001 the Ankara public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicants, along with seventeen other persons who were also members of the executive and auditors boards of the Association. The public prosecutor requested that the accused be sentenced to a fine, under Article 86 of the Law on Associations and Article 119 § 5 of the Criminal Code, for their failure to comply with Articles 29 and 62 of the same Law.\n\nOn 11 September 2001 the Ankara Magistrates' Court (sulh ceza mahkemesi) found the applicants and the other co-accused guilty as charged and, by issuing an order (ceza kararnamesi), sentenced them to an increased fine of TRL 136,890,0000 per person.\n\nOn 8, 9, 12 and 22 October 2001, the applicants filed objections against the decision of 11 September 2001. In their petitions, the applicants maintained that they had been deprived of the opportunity to make defence submissions and that, therefore, they did not receive a fair trial.\n\nThe Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance (asliye ceza mahkemesi) dismissed the applicants' objections on the following dates:\n\n11 October 2001 in respect of İlhami Erseven, Bekir Aslan, Süleyman Çetinkaya and İsmail Kaya;0\n\n15 October 2001 in respect of İsmail Öztorun;\n\n22 October 2001 in respect of Kenan Atakul and Hikmet Yıldırım; and\n\n30 October 2001 in respect of Ellez Duman.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged breach of the applicants' right to a fair hearing to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, who were born in [DATE_TIME] respectively, live in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], [LOCATION] and [PERSON]. They were members of the executive and auditors boards of [LOCATION] (“the Association”), a non‑governmental organisation with its headquarters in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] officers from the [LOCATION] governor's office carried out an inspection at the headquarters of the Association. They found that the members of the executive board had failed to establish a membership registration book and that the members of the auditors board had failed to conduct a periodical inspection of the Association, in breach of Articles 62 and 29 of the Law on Associations (Law no. 2908).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] officers from the Ankara Security Directorate also conducted an inspection of the registers of the association and discovered a number of defects. The Security Directorate then requested an investigation against the members of the executive and auditors boards of the association.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the [LOCATION] public prosecutor imposed a fine of 92,510,0000 Turkish Liras (TRL) per person on the members of the executive and auditors boards of the Association.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a payment order was served on the members of the executive and auditors boards who, however, did not pay the fine within the statutory [DATE_TIME] time-limit.\n\nSubsequently, on [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicants, along with seventeen other persons who were also members of the executive and auditors boards of the Association. The public prosecutor requested that the accused be sentenced to a fine, under Article 86 of the Law on Associations and Article 119 § 5 of the Criminal Code, for their failure to comply with Articles 29 and 62 of the same Law.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ankara Magistrates' Court (sulh ceza mahkemesi) found the applicants and the other co-accused guilty as charged and, by issuing an order (ceza kararnamesi), sentenced them to an increased fine of TRL 136,890,0000 per person.\n\nOn 8, [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the applicants filed objections against the decision of [DATE_TIME]. In their petitions, the applicants maintained that they had been deprived of the opportunity to make defence submissions and that, therefore, they did not receive a fair trial.\n\nThe Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance (asliye ceza mahkemesi) dismissed the applicants' objections on the following dates:\n\n[DATE_TIME] in respect of [PERSON], Bekir Aslan, [PERSON] and [PERSON] Kaya;0\n\n[DATE_TIME] in respect of [PERSON];\n\n[DATE_TIME] in respect of [PERSON] and [LOCATION]; and\n\n[DATE_TIME] in respect of [PERSON].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29483/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Semir Güzel (“the applicant”), on 6 May 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Beştaş and Ms M. Danış Beştaş, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 7 January 2014 the complaint concerning alleged interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression and of assembly was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Diyarbakır.\n\nAt the time of the events in question the applicant was the vice‑president of HAK-PAR (Hak ve Özgürlükler Partisi – the Rights and Freedoms Party).\n\nOn 4 January 2004 the party held its first ordinary congress at a restaurant in Ankara, where the applicant was elected by the delegates to act as the meeting’s chairman.\n\nOn 28 February 2005 a public prosecutor at the Ankara public prosecutor’s office filed an indictment with the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance against thirteen members of HAK-PAR, including the applicant, for acting in violation of section 81 (c) of Law no. 2820 during the congress on the grounds, inter alia, that there had been banners in Kurdish and that most of the speeches given by the delegates had been in Kurdish.\n\nThe applicant acknowledged before the first-instance court that he had not intervened as the chairman when certain delegates had spoken in Kurdish. In this connection, he submitted that, as a founder member of HAK‑PAR, he believed that Kurdish should be used in all areas of life; that those who spoke Kurdish were speaking in their mother tongue; and that he believed that it was neither legal nor ethical for him to intervene to force people to speak in a language other than their mother tongue. He maintained that such speeches could not have constituted an offence, when taking into account laws that had been enacted in compliance with the conditions for membership of the European Union, and the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. In this connection, the applicant also submitted that the relevant provisions of Law no. 2820 were contrary to the Constitution.\n\nOn 7 December 2005 the first-instance court dismissed an application from the defendants to suspend the proceedings and transfer the case to the Constitutional Court for examination of the compatibility of the relevant provisions with the Constitution.\n\nOn 14 February 2007 the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance convicted the applicant of the charges. In particular, the court considered that the applicant had, despite warnings from a government superintendent present at the congress, continued to allow certain delegates to give their speeches in Kurdish, in breach of section 81 (c) of Law no. 2820. The applicant was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.\n\nOn 23 March 2011 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to give any consideration to whether the conditions for suspending the delivery of the judgment against the defendants, pursuant to Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had been met.\n\nOn 6 December 2011 the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance ordered that the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the other defendants be terminated, on the ground that the statutory time-limit prescribed under domestic law had expired.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 10450/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hatem İşcan (“the applicant”), on 15 January 2008. The applicant was represented by Mr A.F. Demirkan, a lawyer practising in Bursa. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 12 June 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Bursa.\n\nIn 2004 the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicant without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicant brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of his property. He requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved his right to increase this claim in due course.\n\nOn 29 December 2005 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicant TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of his land, as requested, plus interest. The applicant initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. 2006/2199).\n\nOn 29 May 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nThe applicant subsequently brought an additional action (“ek dava”) before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain further compensation for his land in the light of the expert report obtained during the previous proceedings, which had valued the land at a rate higher than that initially requested by him.\n\nOn 2 November 2006 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicant TRY 561,050.75, plus interest. The applicant initiated another set of execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain the amount awarded (file no. 2009/2815).\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Karacabey Civil Court.\n\nOn 16 January 2009 the administration paid TRY 9,410.32 to file no. 2006/2199 before the Bursa Execution Office in respect of the debt arising from the initial action.\n\nSubsequently, on 19 March 2009 they paid TRY 789,091.92 to file no. 2009/2815 before the Bursa Execution Office in respect of the debt under the additional action. According to the information provided by the applicant, there has been no outstanding debt in the execution files.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29940/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Richard Woźniak (“the applicant”), on 6 July 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. Danisewicz, a lawyer practising in Gdańsk. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his detention on remand exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 18 January 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Gdańsk.\n\nOn 20 July 2001 the applicant was remanded in custody by the Gdańsk Regional Court on suspicion of murder. The court held that there had been a risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings or abscond, given the severity of the penalty he faced.\n\nLater, several other persons were detained and charged in connection with the same investigation conducted by the Gdańsk District Prosecutor’s Office. The charges against the applicant were also extended.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged on the following dates: 11 October 2001, 10 January, 18 April, 17 September 2002, 28 January, 2 July, 1 October, 30 December 2003, 3 February, 21 April, 7 December 2004, 24 February, 9 June 2005, 29 May and 21 September 2006. The courts relied mainly on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and on the gravity of the charges. The courts considered that the applicant had been charged with the commission of crimes for which he was liable to a sentence of imprisonment exceeding 8 years, and that the circumstances of the case indicated that there was a reasonable risk that he might obstruct the proceedings. Regard was also had to the number of suspects and the need to obtain further evidence.\n\nDuring the investigation and the trial the applicant filed several unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against the decisions prolonging his detention.\n\nFrom 20 March 2002 until 9 May 2002 and from 17 February 2003 until 18 March 2003 the applicant served prison sentences imposed in other sets of criminal proceedings against him.\n\nOn 14 June 2004 the Gdańsk Regional Court delivered a judgment in the case. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 24 February 2005 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal partly quashed the first-instance judgment in respect of the applicant, sentenced him to 6-years’ imprisonment in respect of some of the charges, and remitted the remainder of the case for retrial.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2007 the Gdańsk Regional Court held fourteen hearings in the case.\n\nThe applicant was released on 14 May 2007. The Gdańsk Regional Court found that the necessary pieces of evidence had been obtained and the case was at its final stage, so there was no need to prolong the applicant’s detention.\n\nThe proceedings are pending.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 65017/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Mieczysław Król (“the applicant”), on 3 May 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr L. Lachowicz, a lawyer practising in Komorów, Poland. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and Mr. J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 12 March 2002 the Court decided to communicate the application. to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 21 February 1994 the applicant sued a certain E.K. (“the defendant”) in the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), seeking payment for works which he had carried out for her. On 17 March 1994 the applicant was partly exempted from the payment of court fees.\n\nThe first hearing was fixed for 26 January 1995, but was eventually adjourned since the defendant was ill.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the defendant lodged a counterclaim. The trial court held hearings on: 2 March, 18 April, 6 June and 3 October 1995 and on 16 January and 16 April 1996. The court heard evidence from several witnesses and from the defendant.\n\nOn 16 April 1996 the court ordered that expert evidence be obtained. On 10 May 1996 the expert submitted his opinion to the court. On 24 September 1996 the court held a hearing and heard evidence from the expert. The applicant requested the court to take new expert evidence.\n\nDuring the hearing held on 24 April 1997 the court heard several witnesses. The applicant asked the court to appoint another expert. On 16 June 1997 the applicant applied for an exemption from the costs involved in obtaining an expert opinion. His request was granted on 28 October 1997. On 28 October 1997 another expert submitted his opinion to the trial court.\n\nOn 17 July 1998 the applicant asked the court to set a date for a hearing. He stressed that the court had only held two hearings per year. The next hearing was fixed for 9 November 1998, but was adjourned at the parties' request.\n\nOn 16 April 1999 the applicant again asked the court to obtain new expert evidence and set a date for a hearing as soon as possible. He submitted that he had been suffering from various ailments and for that reason the court should give priority to his case.\n\nOn 8 October 1999 the court, sitting in camera, decided to obtain an opinion from another expert. On 14 December 1999 the expert submitted his opinion to the court.\n\nOn an unspecified later date the applicant complained to the Ombudsman about the length of the proceedings. On 22 October 1999 the Ombudsman informed the applicant that his complaint had been referred to the President of the Warsaw Regional Court.\n\nDuring the hearing held on 15 March 2000 the court heard an expert and ordered the parties to state their position within two weeks. The applicant submitted his pleadings on 27 March 2000.\n\nOn 25 August 2000 the applicant complained to the Minister of Justice, maintaining that the court was particularly slow in dealing with the case. In a letter to the applicant of 29 September 2000 the Minister of Justice conceded that the length of the proceedings was excessive.\n\nOn 11 October 2000 the Regional Court held a hearing. On 7 November 2000 the court held a viewing of the site. On 8 January 2001 and 12 March 2002 the court held further hearings.\n\nOn an unknown later date the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal gave judgments. Upon the applicant's subsequent cassation appeal, the proceedings are pending before the Supreme Court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44034/07) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Danish national, Mr Rolf Nielsen (“the applicant”), on 12 September 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K.L. Németh, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs Nina Holst-Christensen of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn 28 March 2008 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives on the island of Samsø.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1990s a new concept called “tax asset stripping” (selskabstømmersager) came into existence in Denmark. It related mainly to a criminal activity whereby the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for their own profit, “stripped” the companies of assets including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually closely interconnected and collaborated on their criminal activities, which involved very large amounts of money. According to a survey conducted by the customs and tax authorities, approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner (DKK) were stripped in the period from the late 1980s until 1994. In addition to the criminal cases, tax asset stripping gave rise to a large number of cases for damages relating to the sellers’ and the buyer banks’ liability for the loss arising when the companies were stripped of their funds in connection with the sale. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive solvent companies largely ceased in the summer of 1993.\n\nOn 27 November 1992, in his role as owner and managing director, the applicant sold a private limited company originally called Soft TUX Aps, the name later being changed to HOP no. 49.\n\nOn 30 March 1995 HOP no. 49 went bankrupt. A trustee in bankruptcy was appointed to manage the estate and settle the accounts.\n\nOn 6 October 1997 the trustee, on behalf of the bankrupt HOP no. 49, initiated civil proceedings before the High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret), the High Court, against the applicant and a bank (BG Bank A/S), requesting that the defendants be ordered jointly and severally to pay approximately 4.4 million Danish kroner (DKK), equivalent to approximately 594,000 euros (EUR). The trustee alleged that the defendants had been responsible for stripping the company of assets in connection with the above-mentioned sale in 1992.\n\nOn 18 November 1997 the defendant BG Bank A/S joined the proceedings and raised an individual claim against the applicant, an accountancy firm (Revisorhuset A/S) and two lawyers, HAV and PF, as defendants in the main proceedings.\n\nOn 20 November 1997, maintaining that he had been misled by his advisers, the applicant brought proceedings against a lawyer CH, a law firm G and N, an accountant JOL, Revisorhuset A/S and BG Bank A/S as defendants in the main proceedings.\n\nFormally the proceedings included twelve parties. However, since the applicant and BG Bank A/S acted both as defendants and third-party defendants, and Revisorhuset A/S had been joined to the proceedings by both the applicant and BG Bank A/S, the proceedings included nine different parties. Subsequently, in 2002 the proceedings against Revisorhuset A/S were abandoned because it ceased to exist. Six of the remaining eight parties were represented by five different counsels and two of them had no legal representation.\n\nSeven hearings were held and several written pleadings exchanged between October 1997 and 17 September 1999.\n\nOn the latter day all parties, including the applicant, agreed to adjourn the proceedings until 14 January 2000 pending a Supreme Court judgment in a similar case, hereafter called the Else Thrane case. In that case, as in the present case, an estate in bankruptcy had sued the seller of the company for damages as the company had been stripped of its assets in connection with the sale and was therefore unable to pay corporation taxes. Thus, the crucial matter concerned the question of liability of the buyer’s bank and the buyer’s attorney and accountant for the advice provided by them.\n\nThe judgment in the Else Thrane case was passed by the Supreme Court on 24 November 1999 (published in the Danish Weekly Law Reports (Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen 2000, page 365/2), in the light of which the proceedings in the present case were adjourned awaiting the parties’ settlement negotiations. The proceedings and the settlement negotiations were adjourned on 7 April 2000 and several times thereafter because the applicant’s first counsel (L) resigned and the applicant had to appoint a new one.\n\nIn October 2000 new counsel (D) submitted a pleading and the exchange of pleadings and settlement negotiations were therefore resumed until the end of April 2001, when the applicant stated that he did not wish to enter into a settlement. Immediately thereafter, the High Court summoned the parties for a hearing to take place on 15 June 2001, during which the applicant mentioned that it might be possible to reach a settlement if various requests were met. The parties, including the applicant, thus agreed to adjourn the proceedings anew in order to reach a settlement.\n\nIn November 2001, the applicant informed the High Court that his counsel had resigned and that he did not wish to enter into a settlement.\n\nA hearing was held on 22 February 2002, in agreement with the applicant the High Court requested that a new counsel be retained, inter alia to submit a pleading stating on which points, in the applicant’s opinion, the present case differed so much from the Else Thrane case that the Supreme Court’ judgment in that case could not guide the outcome of the present case. A hearing was scheduled for 12 April 2002, at which new counsel (B) appeared for the applicant. However, he informed the High Court on 22 August 2002 that he was no longer handling the applicant’s interests. At a hearing the following day, the applicant was represented by another counsel (S), who although given until 27 September 2002, submitted the awaited pleading on 10 January 2003. Thereafter, pleadings were exchanged regularly and several hearings held.\n\nAt a pre-trial review held on 2 February 2004 only counsel for BG Bank A/S was present. He was requested to investigate whether the applicant was represented by counsel, since the case seemed ready for trial.\n\nIn March 2004, upon request the High Court adjourned the proceedings until 19 January 2005 awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision regarding a claim from BG Bank A/S that it was entitled to a contribution from one of the third‑party defendants.\n\nOn 4 March 2005 the applicant complained about the adjournment and invited the High Court to schedule the trial and accordingly a hearing was held on 22 March 2005. In order to discuss how to schedule the main proceedings and/or the third party cases, a pre-trial review was scheduled to take place on 23 November 2005.\n\nIn a letter of 9 November 2005 to the High Court, the applicant complained about the length of the proceedings and at the same time requested an adjournment of the forthcoming pre-trial review since he wanted a new counsel. He also stated that he would not be in Denmark until Christmas.\n\nOn 22 November 2005 the High Court refused the applicant’s request since, according to the information available, the applicant had not been legally represented since 2 February 2004, and the pre-trial review had been scheduled since 22 March 2005.\n\nThe pre-trial review was held on 23 November 2005 without the applicant’s presence.\n\nBy letter of 8 December 2005, a new counsel, namely the lawyer representing the applicant in the proceedings before the Court, informed the High Court that he was representing the applicant in the domestic proceedings.\n\nAccordingly, and since the applicant alleged that he had not been summoned to the pre-trial review on 23 November 2005, the High Court summoned the parties to another pre-trial review to take place on 4 May 2006. During that review the trial was fixed for five days in August 2007.\n\nOn 23 August 2006, the High Court rescheduled the trial at the request of one of the parties and suggested three alternative periods during the autumn and winter of 2007 which were submitted to the respective parties for comments. The trial was thereafter postponed to take place in September 2007.\n\nCourt sessions were held on 20 August and on 14, 24 and 26 September 2007. A new legal issue arose between the BG Bank A/S and a third-party defendant and the High Court therefore chose to use some of the days reserved for the trial to clarify the matter and for settlement negotiations. At the last session, the trial was scheduled to take place “possibly” from 9 to 11 April 2008, in case the negotiations proved fruitless.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial on 9 April 2008, the applicant claimed that one of the High Court judges had to vacate his seat due to disqualification. Although indicating that it did not find the relevant judge disqualified, the High Court did not want to conduct the trial without the requisite respect for the court’s impartiality. Thus it re-scheduled the trial for October 2008.\n\nThe trial was held in October 2008. On 10 December 2008 the High Court passed judgment finding against the applicant.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the High Court judgment to the Supreme Court (Højesteret) on 19 December 2008.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44034/07) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON] of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives on the island of [LOCATION].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] a new concept called “tax asset stripping” (selskabstømmersager) came into existence in [LOCATION]. It related mainly to a criminal activity whereby the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for their own profit, “stripped” the companies of assets including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually closely interconnected and collaborated on their criminal activities, which involved very large amounts of money. According to a survey conducted by the customs and tax authorities, approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner (DKK) were stripped in the period from [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME]. In addition to the criminal cases, tax asset stripping gave rise to a large number of cases for damages relating to the sellers’ and the buyer banks’ liability for the loss arising when the companies were stripped of their funds in connection with the sale. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive solvent companies largely ceased in [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], in his role as owner and managing director, the applicant sold a private limited company originally called Soft TUX Aps, the name later being changed to HOP no. [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] HOP no. [DATE_TIME] went bankrupt. A trustee in bankruptcy was appointed to manage the estate and settle the accounts.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trustee, on behalf of the bankrupt HOP no. [DATE_TIME], initiated civil proceedings before the High Court of Eastern Denmark ([PERSON]), the High Court, against the applicant and a bank (BG Bank A/S), requesting that the defendants be ordered jointly and severally to pay approximately 4.4 million Danish kroner (DKK), equivalent to approximately 594,000 euros (EUR). The trustee alleged that the defendants had been responsible for stripping the company of assets in connection with the above-mentioned sale in [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the defendant BG Bank A/S joined the proceedings and raised an individual claim against the applicant, an accountancy firm (Revisorhuset A/S) and two lawyers, HAV and PF, as defendants in the main proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], maintaining that he had been misled by his advisers, the applicant brought proceedings against a lawyer CH, a law firm G and N, an accountant [PERSON], Revisorhuset A/S and BG Bank A/S as defendants in the main proceedings.\n\nFormally the proceedings included twelve parties. However, since the applicant and BG Bank A/S acted both as defendants and third-party defendants, and Revisorhuset A/S had been joined to the proceedings by both the applicant and BG Bank A/S, the proceedings included nine different parties. Subsequently, in [DATE_TIME] the proceedings against Revisorhuset A/S were abandoned because it ceased to exist. Six of the remaining eight parties were represented by five different counsels and two of them had no legal representation.\n\nSeven hearings were held and several written pleadings exchanged [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] all parties, including the applicant, agreed to adjourn the proceedings until [DATE_TIME] pending a Supreme Court judgment in a similar case, hereafter called the Else Thrane case. In that case, as in the present case, an estate in bankruptcy had sued the seller of the company for damages as the company had been stripped of its assets in connection with the sale and was therefore unable to pay corporation taxes. Thus, the crucial matter concerned the question of liability of the buyer’s bank and the buyer’s attorney and accountant for the advice provided by them.\n\nThe judgment in the Else Thrane case was passed by the Supreme Court on [DATE_TIME] (published in the Danish Weekly Law Reports (Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen 2000, page 365/2), in the light of which the proceedings in the present case were adjourned awaiting the parties’ settlement negotiations. The proceedings and the settlement negotiations were adjourned on [DATE_TIME] and several times thereafter because the applicant’s first counsel (L) resigned and the applicant had to appoint a new one.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] new counsel (D) submitted a pleading and the exchange of pleadings and settlement negotiations were therefore resumed until [DATE_TIME], when the applicant stated that he did not wish to enter into a settlement. Immediately thereafter, the High Court summoned the parties for a hearing to take place on [DATE_TIME], during which the applicant mentioned that it might be possible to reach a settlement if various requests were met. The parties, including the applicant, thus agreed to adjourn the proceedings anew in order to reach a settlement.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME], the applicant informed the High Court that his counsel had resigned and that he did not wish to enter into a settlement.\n\nA hearing was held on [DATE_TIME], in agreement with the applicant the High Court requested that a new counsel be retained, inter alia to submit a pleading stating on which points, in the applicant’s opinion, the present case differed so much from the Else Thrane case that the Supreme Court’ judgment in that case could not guide the outcome of the present case. A hearing was scheduled for [DATE_TIME], at which new counsel (B) appeared for the applicant. However, he informed the High Court on [DATE_TIME] that he was no longer handling the applicant’s interests. At a hearing [DATE_TIME], the applicant was represented by another counsel (S), who although given until [DATE_TIME], submitted the awaited pleading on [DATE_TIME]. Thereafter, pleadings were exchanged regularly and several hearings held.\n\nAt a pre-trial review held on [DATE_TIME] only counsel for BG Bank A/S was present. He was requested to investigate whether the applicant was represented by counsel, since the case seemed ready for trial.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME], upon request the High Court adjourned the proceedings until [DATE_TIME] awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision regarding a claim from BG Bank A/S that it was entitled to a contribution from one of the third‑party defendants.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant complained about the adjournment and invited the High Court to schedule the trial and accordingly a hearing was held on [DATE_TIME]. In order to discuss how to schedule the main proceedings and/or the third party cases, a pre-trial review was scheduled to take place on [DATE_TIME].\n\nIn a letter of [DATE_TIME] to the High Court, the applicant complained about the length of the proceedings and at the same time requested an adjournment of the forthcoming pre-trial review since he wanted a new counsel. He also stated that he would not be in [LOCATION] until [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the High Court refused the applicant’s request since, according to the information available, the applicant had not been legally represented since [DATE_TIME], and the pre-trial review had been scheduled since [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe pre-trial review was held on [DATE_TIME] without the applicant’s presence.\n\nBy letter of [DATE_TIME], a new counsel, namely the lawyer representing the applicant in the proceedings before the Court, informed the High Court that he was representing the applicant in the domestic proceedings.\n\nAccordingly, and since the applicant alleged that he had not been summoned to the pre-trial review on [DATE_TIME], the High Court summoned the parties to another pre-trial review to take place on [DATE_TIME]. During that review the trial was fixed for [DATE_TIME] in [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the High Court rescheduled the trial at the request of one of the parties and suggested three alternative periods during [DATE_TIME] which were submitted to the respective parties for comments. The trial was thereafter postponed to take place in [DATE_TIME].\n\nCourt sessions were held on [DATE_TIME] and on 14, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. A new legal issue arose between the BG Bank A/S and a third-party defendant and the High Court therefore chose to use some of [DATE_TIME] reserved for the trial to clarify the matter and for settlement negotiations. At the last session, the trial was scheduled to take place “possibly” from [DATE_TIME], in case the negotiations proved fruitless.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial on [DATE_TIME], the applicant claimed that one of the High Court judges had to vacate his seat due to disqualification. Although indicating that it did not find the relevant judge disqualified, the High Court did not want to conduct the trial without the requisite respect for the court’s impartiality. Thus it re-scheduled the trial for [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe trial was held in [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the High Court passed judgment finding against the applicant.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the High Court judgment to the Supreme Court (Højesteret) on [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 30279/07) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Adam Matoń (“the applicant”), on 4 July 2007.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 23 June 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Kraków.\n\n1. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 19 June 2000 the Katowice District Prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against the applicant on charges of drug trafficking, unlawful possession of firearms and membership of an organised criminal gang. There were 36 accused and 147 witnesses in the case.\n\nOn 20 February 2001 the Katowice District Court held a first hearing in the case. From that date to 30 March 2004 the court scheduled two hundred hearings in the case. During that period of time the court held one hundred thirty and two hearings.\n\nOn 13 February 2008 the Katowice District Court gave judgment in the case convicting the applicant. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending before the Katowice Regional Court.\n\n2. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 31 May 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal under the Act of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). He also claimed just satisfaction in the amount of PLN 10,000.\n\nOn 20 July 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the length complaint. Although the court found that the proceedings had lasted a very long time, it concluded that this had not amounted to an “excessive length” as defined by the 2004 Act. The Court of Appeal pointed out that the court had scheduled 58 hearings in 2001, 66 in 2002, 73 in 2003, 64 in 2004 and 85 in 2005. However, several hearings had had to be postponed because defence lawyers, co-accused and witnesses were absent and assessors and judges were ill.\n\nOn 19 October 2006 the applicant lodged another complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 31 January 2007 the Katowice Court of Appeal again dismissed the length complaint. The court found that the proceedings had been handled properly and the delays had been attributable to other persons and unexpected circumstances rather than to the court. The Court of Appeal pointed out that since July 2005 the court had held over 30 hearings and over 30 hearings had had to be postponed because defence lawyers and experts had been absent, assessors, a judge and certain co-accused had been ill, renovation works had been carried out in the hearing room and there had been a shortage of police officers to convey the accused to the court. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the proceedings were of a complex character and noted that the court had taken many appropriate steps in order to speed them up.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 30279/07) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in Kraków.\n\n1. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against the applicant on charges of drug trafficking, unlawful possession of firearms and membership of an organised criminal gang. There were 36 accused and 147 witnesses in the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court held a first hearing in the case. From that date to [DATE_TIME] the court scheduled two hundred hearings in the case. During that period of time the court held one hundred thirty and two hearings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court gave judgment in the case convicting the applicant. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending before the Katowice Regional Court.\n\n2. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal under the Act of [DATE_TIME] on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). He also claimed just satisfaction in the amount of PLN 10,000.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the length complaint. Although the court found that the proceedings had lasted a very long time, it concluded that this had not amounted to an “excessive length” as defined by the 2004 Act. The Court of Appeal pointed out that the court had scheduled 58 hearings in [DATE_TIME], 66 in [DATE_TIME], 73 in [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] in [DATE_TIME] and 85 in [DATE_TIME]. However, several hearings had had to be postponed because defence lawyers, co-accused and witnesses were absent and assessors and judges were ill.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged another complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal again dismissed the length complaint. The court found that the proceedings had been handled properly and the delays had been attributable to other persons and unexpected circumstances rather than to the court. The Court of Appeal pointed out that since [DATE_TIME] the court had held over 30 hearings and over 30 hearings had had to be postponed because defence lawyers and experts had been absent, assessors, a judge and certain co-accused had been ill, renovation works had been carried out in the hearing room and there had been a shortage of police officers to convey the accused to the court. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the proceedings were of a complex character and noted that the court had taken many appropriate steps in order to speed them up.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 10 September 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Kandıra.\n\nOn 9 July 1996 the applicant was arrested in Istanbul during a bank robbery. On 24 July 1996 he was brought before the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who remanded him in custody.\n\nOn 5 August 1996 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant. Invoking Article 146 of the Criminal Code, he accused the applicant of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities which undermined the constitutional order of the State.\n\nThe trial commenced before the Istanbul State Security Court. In the subsequent hearings, the court refused to release the applicant on account of the nature of the alleged offence and the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 11 December 1997 the Istanbul State Security Court pronounced its judgment. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 3 December 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment. The case was accordingly remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court.\n\nOn 5 January 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court resumed the trial. During the subsequent hearings, the court rejected the applicant’s requests for release, having regard to the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 19 December 2002 the Istanbul State Security Court once again convicted the applicant as charged and, pursuant to Article 146 of the Criminal Code, sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 16 September 2003 the Court of Cassation once again quashed the judgment of the first instance court.\n\nThe proceedings continued before the Istanbul State Security Court. On 7 May 2004 the State Security Courts were abolished following a constitutional amendment, and the applicant’s case was transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.\n\nAccording to the information in the case file, the proceedings are still pending and the applicant is still remanded in custody.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 22930/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jan Kachel (“the applicant”), on 17 May 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 13 September 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Tarnów. He is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in Tarnów Prison. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn 30 July 2002 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn 31 July 2002 the Bytom District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. It justified the applicant’s pre‑trial detention by the gravity of the offence, the existence of strong evidence against him, the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed and by the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against the decision to remand him in custody was unsuccessful. On 4 September 2002 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), relying on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a serious offence, upheld the Bytom District Court’s decision.\n\nThe applicant’s pre‑trial detention was subsequently extended by decisions of the Katowice Regional Court of, inter alia, 21 October 2002, 2 December 2002, 31 March 2003 (upheld by the Katowice Court of Appeal on 7 May 2003), 29 July 2003 and 16 June 2004.\n\nOnce the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory two‑year maximum laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the first‑instance court was no longer competent to extend it. Consequently, it was the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) which issued further extensions on, inter alia, 14 July 2004, 8 December 2004, 6 April 2005 and 28 December 2005.\n\nThe courts repeatedly justified the applicant’s pre‑trial detention in the initial phase by the existence of strong evidence against him, the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed and the reasonable risk that the applicant would attempt either to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by other unlawful means. They further stressed that it would be necessary to hear evidence from a large number of witnesses and to obtain expert reports.\n\nIn the latter stages of the applicant’s detention, the courts additionally referred to the complexity of the case and the fact that there was strong evidence against him and other defendants.\n\nIn the meantime, on 16 April 2003 the applicant was indicted on a charge of murder allegedly committed with two accomplices, who were also on trial.\n\nOn 4 July 2005 the Katowice Regional Court convicted the applicant and his co‑defendants as charged. The applicant was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment.\n\nThe prosecutor and the lawyers of all three defendants lodged appeals.\n\nOn 25 January 2006 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the substance of the first‑instance judgment concerning the characterisation of the charges and the sentence.\n\nOn 8 November 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 22930/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr Jan Kachel (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in Tarnów. He is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in [LOCATION]. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bytom District Court ([PERSON]) remanded him in custody. It justified the applicant’s pre‑trial detention by the gravity of the offence, the existence of strong evidence against him, the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed and by the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against the decision to remand him in custody was unsuccessful. On [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), relying on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed a serious offence, upheld the Bytom District Court’s decision.\n\nThe applicant’s pre‑trial detention was subsequently extended by decisions of the Katowice Regional Court of, inter alia, [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] (upheld by the Katowice Court of Appeal on [DATE_TIME]), [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOnce the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory two‑year maximum laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ([PERSON] postępowania karnego), the first‑instance court was no longer competent to extend it. Consequently, it was the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) which issued further extensions on, inter alia, [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe courts repeatedly justified the applicant’s pre‑trial detention in the initial phase by the existence of strong evidence against him, the likelihood that a heavy penalty would be imposed and the reasonable risk that the applicant would attempt either to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by other unlawful means. They further stressed that it would be necessary to hear evidence from a large number of witnesses and to obtain expert reports.\n\nIn the latter stages of the applicant’s detention, the courts additionally referred to the complexity of the case and the fact that there was strong evidence against him and other defendants.\n\nIn the meantime, on [DATE_TIME] the applicant was indicted on a charge of murder allegedly committed with two accomplices, who were also on trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court convicted the applicant and his co‑defendants as charged. The applicant was sentenced to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment.\n\nThe prosecutor and the lawyers of all three defendants lodged appeals.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the substance of the first‑instance judgment concerning the characterisation of the charges and the sentence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court dismissed a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant.",

Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, applicant alleged, in particular, that his right to respect for his family life had been infringed.\n\nOn 1 September 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Łódź.\n\nOn 20 October 2004 the Łódź District Court ordered the applicant's pre-trial detention for a period of fourteen days. The court referred to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant was guilty of fraud while acting in an organised group.\n\nOn 6 June 2006 the applicant was arrested. On 13 June 2006 the Łódź District Court ordered his detention for a period of three months. The court held that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged (including establishing and leading an organised criminal group). Furthermore, he had confessed to the charges. The court also stressed that the detention was necessary in order to ensure the proper course of the proceedings, in particular as the applicant had been in hiding.\n\nIn July his detention was extended until 6 November 2006. The court repeated the reasons previously given.\n\nOn 14 June and 3 July 2006 the applicant's wife, M.G., asked for permission to visit her husband in prison. On 20 June and 5 July 2006 respectively, the Łódź Regional Prosecutor refused her requests. The prosecutor made handwritten notes on M.G.'s applications – “no permission” and “permission refused” respectively (“brak zgody”, “nie wyrażam zgody”).\n\nOn 24 July 2006 the applicant was again refused permission to be visited by his wife and children by the Piotrków Trybunalski District Court. The prosecutor made a handwritten note on the applicant's motion “permission refused” (“nie wyrażam zgody”).\n\nOn 24 September 2006 the applicant was visited by his daughter.\n\nOn 26 October 2006 the Łódź District Court extended the applicant's detention until 6 May 2007. The court held that the original reasons for his detention were still valid. The court also referred to the likelihood of a heavy sentence and the fact that the applicant had acted in a criminal group. The court further refused the applicant's request for release.\n\nOn 21 February 2007 the Łódź District Court refused the applicant's application for release and the replacement of detention by more lenient preventive measures. The court referred to the grounds given in previous decisions.\n\nThe trial began on 4 April 2007. There were sixteen other co‑accused in the proceedings. The prosecutor asked the court to hear 106 witnesses.\n\nAt the hearing held on 29 May 2007 the applicant again asked for the preventive measure to be changed. The court refused his request and extended the detention until 31 July 2007.\n\nBetween 8 June 2007 and 2 May 2008 the applicant was visited by his wife on twelve occasions.\n\nThe applicant's detention was subsequently extended on several occasions, in particular on 23 August and 5 October 2007.\n\nOn 8 May 2008 the applicant was released from detention.\n\nIt would appear that the proceedings are pending.",

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Łódź District Court ordered the applicant's pre-trial detention for a period of [DATE_TIME]. The court referred to the reasonable suspicion that the applicant was guilty of fraud while acting in an organised group.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested. On [DATE_TIME] the Łódź District Court ordered his detention for [DATE_TIME]. The court held that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged (including establishing and leading an organised criminal group). Furthermore, he had confessed to the charges. The court also stressed that the detention was necessary in order to ensure the proper course of the proceedings, in particular as the applicant had been in hiding.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] his detention was extended until [DATE_TIME]. The court repeated the reasons previously given.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant's wife, [PERSON], asked for permission to visit her husband in prison.

The court held that the original reasons for his detention were still valid. The court also referred to the likelihood of a heavy sentence and the fact that the applicant had acted in a criminal group. The court further refused the applicant's request for release.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Łódź District Court refused the applicant's application for release and the replacement of detention by more lenient preventive measures. The court referred to the grounds given in previous decisions.\n\nThe trial began on [DATE_TIME]. There were sixteen other co‑accused in the proceedings. The prosecutor asked the court to hear 106 witnesses.\n\nAt the hearing held on [DATE_TIME] the applicant again asked for the preventive measure to be changed. The court refused his request and extended the detention until [DATE_TIME].\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the applicant was visited by his wife on twelve occasions.\n\nThe applicant's detention was subsequently extended on several occasions, in particular on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released from detention.\n\nIt would appear that the proceedings are pending.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 3042/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Nihat Konak (“the applicant”), on 19 November 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. A. Kırdök, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 20 January 2011 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1964, is currently serving his prison sentence in the Tekirdağ Prison.\n\nOn 26 March 1998, following a house search and the seizure of certain items, the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being a member of the TKP/ML-TIKKO (Communist Party of Turkey//Marxist‑Leninist Turkish Workers and Peasants’ Liberation Army), an illegal organisation.\n\nAccording to the applicant’s statements, he was questioned by police officers on an unspecified date but exercised his right to remain silent. During the questioning, he was not provided with a lawyer.\n\nIn the meantime, on 29 March 1998, a certain co-accused L.L. was confronted with the applicant, in the absence of a lawyer, and identified him as the secretary of the Marmara District and the person responsible for the Istanbul branch of the organisation.\n\nOn 1 April 1998, the applicant and twenty-two other accused persons were examined by a doctor who noted that none of them showed signs of physical violence apart from three of them, including L.L. According to the medical report, L.L. had a three-centimetre ecchymosis on her back and face.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court where he denied the allegations, in the absence of his lawyer. In his statements, the applicant also mentioned that he had not been provided with a lawyer during his police custody despite his request to that effect. He also denied the confrontation and identification records in his statements made to the public prosecutor. After the questioning was over, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nOn 21 April 1998 the Istanbul Public Prosecutor issued an indictment, charging the applicant under section 168 of the former Turkish Criminal Code with being a leader of an armed organisation.\n\nOn 6 July 1998 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn 26 October 2001 the first-instance court convicted the applicant as charged.\n\nOn 19 November 2001 the applicant was detained to serve his prison sentence.\n\nOn 14 February 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the conviction for lack of reasoning.\n\nOn 26 December 2003 the Istanbul State Security Court once again convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to eighteen years and nine months’ imprisonment. It noted that, according to the confrontation and identification records, certain of his co-accused, namely M.Ş., L.L., T.Ö. and M.Ş., had identified the applicant as the district leader of the organisation. It further found it established that he had taken part in a number of the organisation’s activities such as hanging illegal banners, throwing Molotov cocktails and participating in illegal demonstrations. The court concluded that the applicant had acted as district leader of the organisation in Istanbul.\n\nOn 25 May 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in [DATE_TIME], is currently serving his prison sentence in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], following a house search and the seizure of certain items, the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being a member of the TKP/ML-TIKKO (Communist Party of Turkey//Marxist‑Leninist Turkish Workers and Peasants’ Liberation Army), an illegal organisation.\n\nAccording to the applicant’s statements, he was questioned by police officers on an unspecified date but exercised his right to remain silent. During the questioning, he was not provided with a lawyer.\n\nIn the meantime, on [DATE_TIME], a certain co-accused L.L. was confronted with the applicant, in the absence of a lawyer, and identified him as the secretary of [LOCATION] and the person responsible for the [LOCATION] branch of the organisation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the applicant and twenty-two other accused persons were examined by a doctor who noted that none of them showed signs of physical violence apart from three of them, including L.L. According to the medical report, L.L. had a three-centimetre ecchymosis on her back and face.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court where he denied the allegations, in the absence of his lawyer. In his statements, the applicant also mentioned that he had not been provided with a lawyer during his police custody despite his request to that effect. He also denied the confrontation and identification records in his statements made to the public prosecutor. After the questioning was over, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul Public Prosecutor issued an indictment, charging the applicant under section 168 of the former [NRP] Criminal Code with being a leader of an armed organisation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the first-instance court convicted the applicant as charged.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was detained to serve his prison sentence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the conviction for lack of reasoning.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul State Security Court once again convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. It noted that, according to the confrontation and identification records, certain of his co-accused, namely M.Ş., L.L., [LOCATION] and M.Ş., had identified the applicant as the district leader of the organisation. It further found it established that he had taken part in a number of the organisation’s activities such as hanging illegal banners, throwing Molotov cocktails and participating in illegal demonstrations. The court concluded that the applicant had acted as district leader of the organisation in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18403/91) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mrs Anna Evagorou Christou (“the applicant”), on 31 May 1991.\n\nThe applicant, who was granted legal aid, was represented by Mr A. Demetriades, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived her of her home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 24 August 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1925 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant lived with her family in Kalogrea, a village in the District of Kyrenia. During the 1974 intervention, the Turkish military troops evicted the applicant and her family from their home and forced them to leave Kyrenia and flee to the south.\n\nThe applicant alleged that until 7 September 1999, when the properties were transferred to her children, she had been the owner of ten plots of land in Kalogrea, two of which had one house each on them. One of these houses had been the applicant’s home. It was an ancestral house built in 1916, comprising huge, spacious rooms, two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. It had two levels and a huge yard. It was built of stone, had marble floors and a titled roof, and wooden doors and windows. The second house was the applicant’s holiday home, built in 1958 and situated in the locality known as Roukania. It had two spacious bedrooms and was very close to the sea (about 50 metres).\n\nIn support to her claim to ownership, the applicant produced affirmations of ownership issued by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that she was the legal and registered owner of the two houses and of the pieces of lands registered under the plots nos. 260, 268, 45, 119/5, 119/6, 164.9, 121/2/3, 122/2/4, 359/1 and 425. The applicant also produced certificates of registration for eight of the ten properties at issue.\n\nThe applicant claimed that she had been prevented from returning to her home and properties because the Turkish military authorities had continuously occupied and used them.\n\nOn 9 December 1990 the applicant made an attempt to return to her home and property in Kyrenia and in the Kalogrea Village by participating in a convoy of cars of fellow refugees intending to return home. The demonstration organisers had informed the Commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in Cyprus of their intentions.\n\nThe applicant and her fellow refugees stopped at the check point in the “buffer zone“, on the main road linking Nicosia and Famagusta. There, they asked the UN officer on duty to be allowed to return to their homes, property and villages. They requested the same officer to forward their demand to the Turkish military authorities. The officer replied that the latter had refused their request.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18403/91) against [LOCATION] lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mrs [PERSON] Christou (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who was granted legal aid, was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON].\n\nThe applicant alleged that the [NRP] occupation of the northern part of [LOCATION] had deprived her of her home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nThe applicant lived with her family in [LOCATION], a village in [LOCATION]. During the [DATE_TIME] intervention, the [NRP] military troops evicted the applicant and her family from their home and forced them to leave [PERSON] and flee to the south.\n\nThe applicant alleged that until [DATE_TIME], when the properties were transferred to her children, she had been the owner of ten plots of land in [LOCATION], two of which had one house each on them. One of these houses had been the applicant’s home. It was an ancestral house built in [DATE_TIME], comprising huge, spacious rooms, two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. It had two levels and a huge yard. It was built of stone, had marble floors and a titled roof, and wooden doors and windows. The second house was the applicant’s holiday home, built in [DATE_TIME] and situated in the locality known as [PERSON]. It had two spacious bedrooms and was very close to the sea (about 50 metres).\n\nIn support to her claim to ownership, the applicant produced affirmations of ownership issued by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that she was the legal and registered owner of the two houses and of the pieces of lands registered under the plots nos. 260, 268, [DATE_TIME], 119/5, 119/6, [PHONE_NUMBER], 121/2/3, 122/2/4, 359/1 and 425. The applicant also produced certificates of registration for eight of the ten properties at issue.\n\nThe applicant claimed that she had been prevented from returning to her home and properties because the [NRP] military authorities had continuously occupied and used them.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant made an attempt to return to her home and property in [LOCATION] and in [LOCATION] by participating in a convoy of cars of fellow refugees intending to return home. The demonstration organisers had informed the Commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in [LOCATION] of their intentions.\n\nThe applicant and her fellow refugees stopped at the check point in the “buffer zone“, on the main road linking [LOCATION] and [LOCATION]. There, they asked the UN officer on duty to be allowed to return to their homes, property and villages. They requested the same officer to forward their demand to the [NRP] military authorities. The officer replied that the latter had refused their request.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36391/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yusuf Salduz (“the applicant”), on 8 August 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms. T. Aslan, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 28 March 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the lack of legal assistance in police custody and the non-communication of the submissions of the Principal Public Prosecutor, to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn 29 May 2001, the applicant was arrested by police officers from the anti-terrorism branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of having participated in an illegal demonstration in support of the imprisoned leader of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, an illegal organisation). The applicant was also accused of hanging an illegal placard on a bridge in Bornova on 26 April 2001.\n\nOn 30 May 2001 the police officers took a statement from the applicant in which he admitted the charges.\n\nOn 1 June 2001 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge. Before both officials, the applicant denied the content of his police statement, alleging that it had been extracted from him under duress. The same day, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nOn 11 July 2001 the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed an indictment with the same court, accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting the PKK, an offence under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of Law no. 3713 (the anti-terrorism law).\n\nOn 5 December 2001 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment. This sentence was then reduced to two and a half years’ imprisonment as the applicant had been less than eighteen years of age at the time of the offence.\n\nWhen delivering its judgment, the Izmir State Security Court had taken into consideration the statements which the applicant had made to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, as well as his co-defendants’ testimony before the public prosecutor. The court noted that the latter had given evidence that the applicant had organised them to participate in the demonstration. The court further took note of the expert report which suggested that the applicant’s handwriting was identical to that on the placard. The court also noted that, according to the arrest report drawn up by the police, the applicant had been among the people who dispersed after the demonstration.\n\nOn 27 March 2002, the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion to the 9th Chamber of the Court of Cassation, in which he had argued that the Chamber should uphold the judgment of the Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn 10 June 2002 the 9th Chamber of the Court of Cassation confirmed that judgment.",

It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Siemanowice.\n\nOn 28 April 2005 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of bribery, several counts of evasion of tax and customs duties and several counts of forgery, committed in an organised criminal gang.\n\nOn 29 April 2005 the Katowice District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. The court referred to the complexity of the case and the considerable number of accused. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence and induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence.\n\nLater, twenty-one other persons were detained and charged in connection with the investigation against the applicant.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against the detention order, like his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful. In his applications and appeal, he argued that the charge against him was based on unreliable and contradictory evidence.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was prolonged on 22 July 2005, 20 October 2005, 20 January 2006, 29 March 2006, 28 June 2006, 27 September 2006, 4 January 2007 and 4 April 2007.\n\nOn 17 April 2007 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court. The applicant was charged with bribery, several counts of evasion of tax and customs duties, several counts of forgery and membership of an organised criminal gang. The bill of indictment also concerned twenty-one other persons.\n\nFurther decisions extending the applicant’s detention were taken on 25 July 2007, 24 October 2007 and 27 February 2008. In a decision given on 24 October 2007, the Katowice Court of Appeal Court criticised the manner in which the investigation had been conducted. It also referred to delays in the proceedings which amounted to six months. It acknowledged that almost all the evidence had been gathered and that the risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence had been marginal. In a decision given on 27 February 2008, the Katowice Court of Appeal ruled that the applicant could be released on bail on payment of security of 800,000 Polish zlotys. The applicant requested the court to reduce the amount of bail. On 28 March 2008 the court reduced it to 300,000 Polish zlotys. The applicant paid the security and he was released on 30 April 2008.\n\nThe criminal proceedings are currently pending before the first‑instance court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18623/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cahit Demirel (“the applicant”), on 29 April 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Beştaş and Mrs M. Beştaş, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 11 September 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the applicant’s right to release pending trial, to take proceedings to challenge the lawfulness of his detention and to a fair hearing within a reasonable time. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Batman.\n\nOn 1 April 1996 the applicant was arrested by gendarmerie officers while he was leaving Batman. He was then transferred to the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Batman Police Headquarters on suspicion of involvement in the activities of the PKK (the Workers’ Party of Kurdistan), an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 18 April 1996 the applicant was brought before the Batman public prosecutor and the judge at the Batman Magistrates’ Court. The judge remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nOn an unspecified day the Batman public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the case file to the public prosecutor’s office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court.\n\nOn 22 May 1996 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with other persons, charging him with membership of the PKK under Article 168 § 2 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn 30 July 1996 the Diyarbakır State Security Court held the first hearing on the merits of the case.\n\nOn 25 December 2001 the Fourth Chamber of the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the applicant and his representative requested several times that the applicant be released pending trial. At the end of each hearing the State Security Court rejected the applicant’s requests, having regard to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the content of the case file.\n\nOn 9 October 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. The case was subsequently remitted to the Diyarbakır State Security Court.\n\nOn 13 May 2003 the Diyarbakır State Security Court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial.\n\nOn 23 March 2004 the State Security Court once again convicted the applicant under Article 168 § 2 of the former Criminal Code and sentenced him to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment.\n\nOn 19 October 2004 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 23 March 2004.\n\nPursuant to Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, abolishing State Security Courts, the case against the applicant was transferred to the Diyarbakır Assize Court.\n\nOn 2 May 2005 the Diyarbakır Assize Court decided that the proceedings against the applicant should be terminated on the ground that the statutory time‑limit under Article 102 of the Criminal Code had expired. This decision to terminate the case became final as neither the applicant nor the public prosecutor appealed.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 20491/92) against the Swiss Confederation lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an American national of Yugoslav origin, Mr Rajko Medenica (“the applicant”), on 3 August 1992.\n\nThe applicant, who died on 30 November 1997, was represented by Mr C. Poncet, of the Geneva Bar, and also, until the beginning of 1997, by Mr D. Warluzel, likewise of the Geneva Bar. His widow, Mrs Smilja Medenica, and children, Mr Dimitrije Medenica and Ms Olivera Medenica, expressed their wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court in their capacity as his heirs. The Swiss Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Boillat, Head of the International Affairs Division, Federal Office of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the Assize Court of the Canton of Geneva had tried and convicted him in absentia, in breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of 16 December 1999 the Court declared the application partly admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court’s decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n\nAfter consulting the parties, the Court decided to dispense with a hearing of the merits of the case (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant arrived in Switzerland in 1966 and qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1970. He worked as a doctor in Geneva Cantonal Hospital. From 1973 onwards he was responsible for coordinating relations between Geneva Cantonal Hospital and the relevant bodies in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On account of his nationality of origin and knowledge of languages, he was more particularly responsible for looking after the Yugoslav patients in the Geneva Hospital.\n\nOn 27 March 1981 the Principal Public Prosecutor for the Canton of Geneva commenced criminal proceedings against him following a complaint by the State of Geneva. The applicant was accused of causing Yugoslavia’s welfare institutions to sustain substantial losses with the complicity of an official at the consulate of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Geneva.\n\nOn 9 September 1981 and over the period that followed, the applicant was questioned several times by the cantonal investigating judge. On 27 October 1982 he was arrested and charged with fraud, intimidation and forging documents.\n\nOn 13 January 1984 the Indictment Division of the Canton of Geneva ordered the applicant’s release on bail on payment of a sum as security. On 27 January 1984 the initial investigation was completed and the case file sent to the Principal Public Prosecutor for a decision on whether to proceed with the prosecution. On 1 February 1984 the applicant paid the stipulated sum and was released.\n\nHe then travelled to the United States of America, where he acquired American nationality and practised as a doctor specialising in the treatment of certain serious forms of cancer.\n\nBy an initial order of 3 February 1986 the Indictment Division of the Canton of Geneva committed the applicant for trial at the Canton of Geneva Assize Court. That order was subsequently set aside on an application by the applicant.\n\nOn 11 March 1987 the Indictment Division made a fresh order committing the applicant for trial at the Canton of Geneva Assize Court. Appeals by the applicant against that order were dismissed.\n\nAt a preliminary meeting on 30 June 1988 the President of the Assize Court discussed the case with a prosecution representative and the applicant’s lawyers in Geneva. He informed them that the case might be set down for trial between January and May 1989.\n\nAt a hearing on 27 September 1988 the President of the Assize Court informed the parties that the trial would commence on 17 April 1989.\n\nThe President of the Assize Court held a further hearing on 13 March 1989 after giving notice to the parties. At the hearing one of the lawyers for the defence indicated that he envisaged making “an application for an adjournment of the trial”.\n\nOn 15 March 1989 the President of the Assize Court made an order for the applicant to appear before the Assize Court on 17 April 1989.\n\nOn 16 March 1989 he questioned the applicant in the presence of his lawyer. The applicant confirmed that he would attend the trial. After the hearing he returned to the United States.\n\nOn 17 March 1989 S., one of the applicant’s American patients, applied to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, Charleston Division, for orders requiring the applicant to continue to treat him until he could be replaced by another doctor and, in the interim, prohibiting him from leaving the United States. He maintained that his life would be in danger if there were any interruption in the treatment he was receiving from the applicant.\n\nOn 20 March 1989 the President of the District Court granted the application in the applicant’s absence and made a temporary restraining order prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory of the United States until he was examined by the District Court at a hearing to be held on 27 March.\n\nOn 22 March 1989 one of the applicant’s Geneva lawyers and an American lawyer acting for him informed the Canton of Geneva prosecuting authorities of that order.\n\nA hearing took place on 27 March 1989 before the President of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The applicant stated that he did not know any doctor who was capable of taking over the treatment of his patients. One of the applicant’s lawyers informed the District Court that under Swiss procedural rules an accused had no guarantee that he or she would be served with the documentary evidence in the case file or that there would be a proper adversarial hearing. He also said that there was a risk that the applicant would face the death sentence in Switzerland.\n\nOn 28 March 1989 the American court issued a restraining order prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory of the United States of America and requiring him to surrender his passport. That decision was served on the Swiss authorities, including the Principal Public Prosecutor of the Canton of Geneva, who was given sixty days in which to respond. The applicant was requested to find replacement doctors for his patients.\n\nAfter serving the American court’s order on the Canton of Geneva prosecuting authorities, the applicant’s lawyers made several applications for an adjournment of the trial, on 30 March and 4 April 1989 and at the start of the trial at the Canton of Geneva Assize Court on 17 April 1989.\n\nIn an order of 19 April 1989 the President of the Assize Court declined to adjourn the trial, holding that the applicant had been absent without good cause. He found that it had not been proved that the accused had been unable to attend the trial for a reason beyond his control. On the contrary, there was a consistent body of evidence that showed that the reason relied on by the applicant had not been beyond his control. The President noted, in particular, that the American order had been made largely in reliance on evidence from the applicant’s patients, in other words on information of no scientific weight; furthermore, the applicant had consistently benefited over a number of years from the support of American figures who were highly influential in South Carolina and close both to the judge and to the applicant. The President observed that the decision appeared very favourable to the applicant, who had not appealed against it, despite being entitled to do so. Lastly, it was not to be overlooked that the applicant had known for a long time that he would stand trial. He had been told the approximate date of his trial in June 1988 and the exact date in September 1988 and it had accordingly been his duty as a doctor to ensure that there was a replacement for him if he really wished to appear for trial.\n\nHearings were held by the Assize Court, composed of the President and twelve jurors, from 17 April 1989 onwards. The applicant did not appear but his two lawyers were present.\n\nOn 26 April 1989 the applicant lodged an application with the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to have the restraining order of 28 March 1989 set aside, notably on the ground that it infringed the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution, which guaranteed personal liberty and the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions respectively. In reply to a request by the applicant for a hearing date, the District Court informed him on 10 May 1989 that it would not be able to examine the merits of the application for another thirty to sixty days.\n\nIn a judgment of 26 May 1989 the Canton of Geneva Assize Court convicted the applicant in absentia and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment, of which two years, eight months and twenty-five days remained to be served. It also made an order excluding him from Swiss territory for ten years. The Assize Court found the applicant guilty on 300 out of 302 counts of forging documents and of a like number of counts of fraud. The applicant was also found guilty of forgery of documents for procuring the signing by his secretary of seventeen false receipts for expenses in a name she no longer used. The jury assessed the amount of alleged damage at approximately 1,000,000 Swiss francs. On the other hand, the applicant was acquitted by the jury on 672 counts of forging documents. The offences to which the convictions related had been committed between 1973 and 1981.\n\nAn application for the applicant’s immediate arrest made by the Principal Public Prosecutor after the delivery of the verdict was dismissed by the Assize Court in view, notably, of the fact that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted had been committed a long time before and that a committal warrant could be issued once the judgment had become final.\n\nOn 17 July 1989 the applicant lodged an application with the Court of Justice of the Canton of Geneva for the conviction in absentia to be set aside, under Article 331 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 below). He maintained that good cause had been shown for his absence at the hearing on 17 April 1989, as he had been compelled to comply with the enforceable decision of the American court – which clearly constituted a reason beyond his control – and that his case should therefore be remitted to the Assize Court.\n\nOn 20 November 1989 the Criminal Division of the Court of Justice dismissed the application. It noted that the wording of Article 331 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure made it clear that in order to have a judgment of the Assize Court set aside, the convicted person had to show good cause for failing to appear for trial. Referring to the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation’s case-law, the Criminal Division stated that any failure to appear due to absence, illness or any other case of force majeure, such as unawareness of the investigation or prosecution, could constitute good cause. Whether the reason preventing appearance was beyond the control of the accused was accordingly the criterion for distinguishing a reason that justified quashing a conviction from one that did not. The Court of Justice held, in particular, that the applicant had been seriously at fault in not transmitting his medical knowledge to other practitioners despite knowing from 1 February 1984 onwards, the date of his release, that he would one day stand trial. His trial had eventually begun five years after his release on bail, so he had had ample time to pass on his experience to others, and to instruct and train them in his method of treatment, even though it was highly sophisticated. Before the American court, he had done no more than make vague statements to the effect that he had long since organised training courses for various doctors with a view to sharing his knowledge with them. However, on each occasion that the question had been put to him, he had repeated that only he could treat his patients and that without his care they would be certain to die. The Court of Justice described that attitude as irresponsible. The applicant was also held to be at fault for having delayed in appealing against the decision of the American court. The appeal had been lodged on 26 April 1989, that is to say a week after his trial had actually begun, and his application for an adjournment had been dismissed. By that juncture, for reasons of time, he could no longer reverse the course of events he had helped set in motion.\n\nOn 2 February 1990 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against the judgment of the Court of Justice of 20 November 1989 dismissing his application for relief.\n\nOn 8 March 1990 the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina set aside the order of 28 March 1989 and ordered the return of the applicant’s passport.\n\nOn 16 May 1990 the applicant attended the hearing before the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation.\n\nIn a judgment of 27 June 1990 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded, holding that he had brought about the situation that had prevented him from leaving his patients and appearing before the Assize Court by his own conduct. In addition, statements he had made to the United States District Court cast doubt on whether he had genuinely intended to travel to Switzerland to stand trial. Further evidence of his bad faith was provided by the fact that he had misled the American court about the procedure that would be followed in the criminal proceedings against him in Geneva. The Court of Cassation considered that the applicant had done everything in his power, notably by making remarks that assisted his opponent’s case, to ensure the eventual success of the application to the American court for an order restraining him from travelling to Switzerland to stand trial. It held that the applicant’s inability to appear before the Assize Court was his own fault in that he had made a decisive contribution to that outcome.\n\nOn 1 October 1990 the applicant lodged with the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation a notice of appeal on points of law against the Assize Court’s judgment of 26 May 1989.\n\nOn 14 February 1991 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It held that the argument concerning the refusal to remit the case had been conclusively disposed of in its judgment of 27 June 1990. It further held that, in so far as they were not inadmissible as being out of time, having been dismissed in the earlier proceedings, the complaints of violations of the rights of the defence were ill-founded. Lastly, the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s argument concerning the legal definition of the offences of fraud and forging documents.\n\nThe applicant lodged a public-law appeal with the Federal Court, seeking to have set aside the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation’s judgments of 27 June 1990 and 14 February 1991. He alleged, inter alia, a violation of his right to be heard and to attend his trial and of his right to a fair hearing, equality of arms and a properly composed and functioning court.\n\nIn a judgment of 23 December 1991, which was served on the applicant’s lawyers on 6 February 1992, the Federal Court dismissed his appeal. It held that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention did not preclude a trial being held in the defendant’s absence if the defendant refused to attend or was unable to attend through his or her own fault. It considered that the applicant had misled the American court by making inaccurate statements, notably regarding Swiss procedure, in order to secure a judgment making it impossible for him to attend his trial; indeed, his American lawyers had admitted as much. In that connection, the Federal Court noted that the applicant had said that he had been held without charges in Geneva for sixteen months and feared that he would be sentenced to death in Switzerland. He had also stated that the defence had been denied access to the case file and had not been able to take part in the earlier proceedings. Referring to an opinion on American law that had been sent to the Assize Court by the Swiss embassy in Washington, the Federal Court also agreed with the cantonal authorities’ findings that the applicant had failed to appeal effectively against the American court’s order of 28 March 1989 in that he had not appealed to a court (the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit) that could have found in his favour. The Federal Court noted that, according to the author of the legal opinion, the decision of the American court was contrary to the public interest and defied common sense, and an appeal to the higher court would have had good prospects of success. As regards good faith, the applicant could not avoid his obligation to appear before the Swiss courts by relying on a decision that was ultimately based on equivocal and even knowingly inaccurate statements that he had made to the American court. The Federal Court held that the Court of Cassation had not acted arbitrarily in finding that, even supposing that the applicant had not brought about the American court’s decision barring him from attending his trial, he had facilitated that decision by supporting his patient S.’s argument. Besides, his American lawyer had not sought to conceal that the aim of the defence had been to obtain an adjournment of the trial in Switzerland. Although that lawyer had been to Geneva and was in close contact with his client’s Geneva counsel, he had not given the American court accurate information about the procedure that would be followed or the sentence the applicant would face if convicted. In the Federal Court’s opinion, it was possible to infer from the foregoing that it was the applicant’s own fault that he had been unable to attend his trial.\n\nOn 26 July 1995 the applicant was arrested at Munich Airport (Germany) on his way to a conference. He was extradited to Switzerland and transferred to Champ-Dollon Prison. An application he made for a pardon was refused in February 1996. He served the remainder of his sentence, spending part of it in a secure wing of Geneva Cantonal Hospital. On 20 December 1996 he returned to the United States.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 20491/92) against the Swiss Confederation lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an [NRP] national of [NRP] origin, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who died on [DATE_TIME], was represented by Mr [PERSON], of the Geneva Bar, and also, until [DATE_TIME], by [PERSON], likewise of the Geneva Bar. His widow, [PERSON], and children, Mr [PERSON] and [PERSON], expressed their wish to pursue the proceedings before the Court in their capacity as his heirs. The Swiss Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON], Head of the International Affairs Division, Federal Office of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the Assize Court of the Canton of [LOCATION] had tried and convicted him in absentia, in breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court’s decision is obtainable from the Registry].\n\nAfter consulting the parties, the Court decided to dispense with a hearing of the merits of the case (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant arrived in [LOCATION] in [DATE_TIME] and qualified as a doctor of medicine in [DATE_TIME]. He worked as a doctor in Geneva Cantonal Hospital. From [DATE_TIME] onwards he was responsible for coordinating relations between Geneva Cantonal Hospital and the relevant bodies in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On account of his nationality of origin and knowledge of languages, he was more particularly responsible for looking after the [NRP] patients in the Geneva Hospital.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Principal Public Prosecutor for the Canton of Geneva commenced criminal proceedings against him following a complaint by the State of Geneva. The applicant was accused of causing [LOCATION]’s welfare institutions to sustain substantial losses with the complicity of an official at the consulate of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and over the period that followed, the applicant was questioned several times by the cantonal investigating judge. On [DATE_TIME] he was arrested and charged with fraud, intimidation and forging documents.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Indictment Division of the Canton of Geneva ordered the applicant’s release on bail on payment of a sum as security. On [DATE_TIME] the initial investigation was completed and the case file sent to the Principal Public Prosecutor for a decision on whether to proceed with the prosecution. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant paid the stipulated sum and was released.\n\nHe then travelled to [LOCATION], where he acquired [NRP] nationality and practised as a doctor specialising in the treatment of certain serious forms of cancer.\n\nBy an initial order of [DATE_TIME] the Indictment Division of the Canton of [LOCATION] committed the applicant for trial at the Canton of Geneva Assize Court. That order was subsequently set aside on an application by the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Indictment Division made a fresh order committing the applicant for trial at the Canton of Geneva Assize Court. Appeals by the applicant against that order were dismissed.\n\nAt a preliminary meeting on [DATE_TIME] the President of the Assize Court discussed the case with a prosecution representative and the applicant’s lawyers in [LOCATION]. He informed them that the case might be set down for trial [DATE_TIME].\n\nAt a hearing on [DATE_TIME] the President of the Assize Court informed the parties that the trial would commence on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe President of the Assize Court held a further hearing on [DATE_TIME] after giving notice to the parties. At the hearing one of the lawyers for the defence indicated that he envisaged making “an application for an adjournment of the trial”.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Assize Court made an order for the applicant to appear before the Assize Court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] he questioned the applicant in the presence of his lawyer. The applicant confirmed that he would attend the trial. After the hearing he returned to [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] S., one of the applicant’s [NRP] patients, applied to [LOCATION] for [LOCATION], Charleston Division, for orders requiring the applicant to continue to treat him until he could be replaced by another doctor and, in the interim, prohibiting him from leaving [LOCATION]. He maintained that his life would be in danger if there were any interruption in the treatment he was receiving from the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the District Court granted the application in the applicant’s absence and made a temporary restraining order prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory of [LOCATION] until he was examined by the District Court at a hearing to be held on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] one of the applicant’s [LOCATION] lawyers and an [NRP] lawyer acting for him informed the Canton of [LOCATION] prosecuting authorities of that order.\n\nA hearing took place on [DATE_TIME] before the President of [LOCATION] for [LOCATION]. The applicant stated that he did not know any doctor who was capable of taking over the treatment of his patients. One of the applicant’s lawyers informed the District Court that under [NRP] procedural rules an accused had no guarantee that he or she would be served with the documentary evidence in the case file or that there would be a proper adversarial hearing. He also said that there was a risk that the applicant would face the death sentence in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the [NRP] court issued a restraining order prohibiting the applicant from leaving the territory of [LOCATION] and requiring him to surrender his passport. That decision was served on the [NRP] authorities, including the Principal Public Prosecutor of the Canton of Geneva, who was given [DATE_TIME] in which to respond. The applicant was requested to find replacement doctors for his patients.\n\nAfter serving the [NRP] court’s order on the Canton of [LOCATION] prosecuting authorities, the applicant’s lawyers made several applications for an adjournment of the trial, on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and at the start of the trial at the Canton of Geneva Assize Court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nIn an order of [DATE_TIME] the President of the Assize Court declined to adjourn the trial, holding that the applicant had been absent without good cause. He found that it had not been proved that the accused had been unable to attend the trial for a reason beyond his control. On the contrary, there was a consistent body of evidence that showed that the reason relied on by the applicant had not been beyond his control. The President noted, in particular, that the [NRP] order had been made largely in reliance on evidence from the applicant’s patients, in other words on information of no scientific weight; furthermore, the applicant had consistently benefited over [DATE_TIME] from the support of [NRP] figures who were highly influential in [LOCATION] and close both to the judge and to the applicant. The President observed that the decision appeared very favourable to the applicant, who had not appealed against it, despite being entitled to do so. Lastly, it was not to be overlooked that the applicant had known for a long time that he would stand trial. He had been told the approximate date of his trial in [DATE_TIME] and the exact date in [DATE_TIME] and it had accordingly been his duty as a doctor to ensure that there was a replacement for him if he really wished to appear for trial.\n\nHearings were held by the Assize Court, composed of the President and twelve jurors, from [DATE_TIME] onwards. The applicant did not appear but his two lawyers were present.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged an application with [LOCATION] for [LOCATION] to have the restraining order of [DATE_TIME] set aside, notably on the ground that it infringed the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of [LOCATION], which guaranteed personal liberty and the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions respectively. In reply to a request by the applicant for a hearing date, the District Court informed him on [DATE_TIME] that it would not be able to examine the merits of the application for [DATE_TIME].\n\nIn a judgment of 26 [DATE_TIME] the Canton of Geneva Assize Court convicted the applicant in absentia and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment, of which [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] remained to be served. It also made an order excluding him from [NRP] territory for [DATE_TIME]. The Assize Court found the applicant guilty on 300 out of 302 counts of forging documents and of a like number of counts of fraud. The applicant was also found guilty of forgery of documents for procuring the signing by his secretary of seventeen false receipts for expenses in a name she no longer used. The jury assessed the amount of alleged damage at approximately 1,000,000 Swiss francs. On the other hand, the applicant was acquitted by the jury on 672 counts of forging documents. The offences to which the convictions related had been committed [DATE_TIME].\n\nAn application for the applicant’s immediate arrest made by the Principal Public Prosecutor after the delivery of the verdict was dismissed by the Assize Court in view, notably, of the fact that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted had been committed a long time before and that a committal warrant could be issued once the judgment had become final.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged an application with the Court of Justice of the Canton of Geneva for the conviction in absentia to be set aside, under Article 331 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 below). He maintained that good cause had been shown for his absence at the hearing on [DATE_TIME], as he had been compelled to comply with the enforceable decision of the [NRP] court – which clearly constituted a reason beyond his control – and that his case should therefore be remitted to the Assize Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Criminal Division of the Court of Justice dismissed the application. It noted that the wording of Article 331 of the Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure made it clear that in order to have a judgment of the Assize Court set aside, the convicted person had to show good cause for failing to appear for trial. Referring to the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation’s case-law, the Criminal Division stated that any failure to appear due to absence, illness or any other case of force majeure, such as unawareness of the investigation or prosecution, could constitute good cause. Whether the reason preventing appearance was beyond the control of the accused was accordingly the criterion for distinguishing a reason that justified quashing a conviction from one that did not. The Court of Justice held, in particular, that the applicant had been seriously at fault in not transmitting his medical knowledge to other practitioners despite knowing from [DATE_TIME] onwards, the date of his release, that he would [DATE_TIME] stand trial. His trial had eventually begun [DATE_TIME] after his release on bail, so he had had ample time to pass on his experience to others, and to instruct and train them in his method of treatment, even though it was highly sophisticated. Before the [NRP] court, he had done no more than make vague statements to the effect that he had long since organised training courses for various doctors with a view to sharing his knowledge with them. However, on each occasion that the question had been put to him, he had repeated that only he could treat his patients and that without his care they would be certain to die. The Court of Justice described that attitude as irresponsible. The applicant was also held to be at fault for having delayed in appealing against the decision of the [NRP] court. The appeal had been lodged on [DATE_TIME], that is to say [DATE_TIME] after his trial had actually begun, and his application for an adjournment had been dismissed. By that juncture, for reasons of time, he could no longer reverse the course of events he had helped set in motion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against the judgment of the Court of Justice of [DATE_TIME] dismissing his application for relief.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] [LOCATION] for [LOCATION] set aside the order of [DATE_TIME] and ordered the return of the applicant’s passport.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant attended the hearing before the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation.\n\nIn a judgment of [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal as unfounded, holding that he had brought about the situation that had prevented him from leaving his patients and appearing before the Assize Court by his own conduct. In addition, statements he had made to [LOCATION] cast doubt on whether he had genuinely intended to travel to [LOCATION] to stand trial. Further evidence of his bad faith was provided by the fact that he had misled the [NRP] court about the procedure that would be followed in the criminal proceedings against him in [LOCATION]. The Court of Cassation considered that the applicant had done everything in his power, notably by making remarks that assisted his opponent’s case, to ensure the eventual success of the application to the [NRP] court for an order restraining him from travelling to [LOCATION] to stand trial. It held that the applicant’s inability to appear before the Assize Court was his own fault in that he had made a decisive contribution to that outcome.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged with the Canton of Geneva Court of Cassation a notice of appeal on points of law against the Assize Court’s judgment of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. It held that the argument concerning the refusal to remit the case had been conclusively disposed of in its judgment of [DATE_TIME]. It further held that, in so far as they were not inadmissible as being out of time, having been dismissed in the earlier proceedings, the complaints of violations of the rights of the defence were ill-founded. Lastly, the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s argument concerning the legal definition of the offences of fraud and forging documents.\n\nThe applicant lodged a public-law appeal with the Federal Court, seeking to have set aside [LOCATION] judgments of [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. He alleged, inter alia, a violation of his right to be heard and to attend his trial and of his right to a fair hearing, equality of arms and a properly composed and functioning court.\n\nIn a judgment of [DATE_TIME], which was served on the applicant’s lawyers on [DATE_TIME], the Federal Court dismissed his appeal. It held that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention did not preclude a trial being held in the defendant’s absence if the defendant refused to attend or was unable to attend through his or her own fault. It considered that the applicant had misled the [NRP] court by making inaccurate statements, notably regarding [NRP] procedure, in order to secure a judgment making it impossible for him to attend his trial; indeed, his [NRP] lawyers had admitted as much. In that connection, the Federal Court noted that the applicant had said that he had been held without charges in [LOCATION] for [DATE_TIME] and feared that he would be sentenced to death in [LOCATION]. He had also stated that the defence had been denied access to the case file and had not been able to take part in the earlier proceedings. Referring to an opinion on [NRP] law that had been sent to the Assize Court by the [NRP] embassy in [LOCATION], the Federal Court also agreed with the cantonal authorities’ findings that the applicant had failed to appeal effectively against the [NRP] court’s order of [DATE_TIME] in that he had not appealed to a court (the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit) that could have found in his favour. The Federal Court noted that, according to the author of the legal opinion, the decision of the [NRP] court was contrary to the public interest and defied common sense, and an appeal to the higher court would have had good prospects of success. As regards good faith, the applicant could not avoid his obligation to appear before the [NRP] courts by relying on a decision that was ultimately based on equivocal and even knowingly inaccurate statements that he had made to the [NRP] court. The Federal Court held that the Court of Cassation had not acted arbitrarily in finding that, even supposing that the applicant had not brought about the [NRP] court’s decision barring him from attending his trial, he had facilitated that decision by supporting his patient [PERSON]’s argument. Besides, his [NRP] lawyer had not sought to conceal that the aim of the defence had been to obtain an adjournment of the trial in [LOCATION]. Although that lawyer had been to [LOCATION] and was in close contact with his client’s [LOCATION] counsel, he had not given the [NRP] court accurate information about the procedure that would be followed or the sentence the applicant would face if convicted. In the Federal Court’s opinion, it was possible to infer from the foregoing that it was the applicant’s own fault that he had been unable to attend his trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested at [LOCATION] ([LOCATION]) on his way to a conference. He was extradited to [LOCATION] and transferred to Champ-Dollon Prison. An application he made for a pardon was refused in [DATE_TIME]. He served the remainder of his sentence, spending part of it in a secure wing of Geneva Cantonal Hospital. On [DATE_TIME] he returned to [LOCATION].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31080/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Hıdır Ateş and Ms Hünkar Demirel (“the applicants”), on 1 August 2002.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr Ö Kılıç, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 29 June 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1979 and 1951 respectively and live in Istanbul. The first applicant was the editor-in-chief of a weekly newspaper, Yedinci Gündem, and the second applicant was its owner.\n\nIn August 2001, in the tenth issue of the newspaper, an article which contained an interview with Cemil Bayık, who was one of the leaders of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party), was published. The relevant parts of the interview read as follows: “Three years have passed since the PKK declared a ceasefire to stop the bloodshed and to contribute to the peace process. Subsequently, the PKK withdrew its armed forces out of Turkey to maintain peace. However, the state did not take any steps for democratisation or to solve the Kurdish problem. ... The case brought against our leader Abdullah Öcalan is a case against the Kurdish people. Therefore, it is not our Prime Minister who wishes to be tried before the European Court of Human Rights, but it is our people. The law was violated in İmralı and, consequently, the death penalty imposed on Öcalan and on our people is not legitimate. All things considered, it is natural that our people have expectations from the European Court of Human Rights, the court of Europe which defends democracy, human rights and the rule of law. ...”\n\nOn 10 September 2001 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicants. By referring to the above-mentioned paragraphs of the interview, the public prosecutor accused the applicants of having allowed the publication of the declarations of an illegal armed terrorist organisation. The charges were brought under Article 6 §§ 2 and 4 of the Law on the Prevention of Terrorism (Law no. 3713), additional Article 2 of the Press Law (Law no. 5680) and Article 36 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 27 December 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court, composed of three civilian judges, convicted the applicants as charged and fined them 2,034,900,0000 Turkish liras (TRL) and TRL 4,069,800,0000 respectively. The first instance court further ordered temporary closure of the newspaper for a period of fifteen days.\n\nThe applicants appealed. On an unspecified date, the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the applicants' appeal. The opinion was not notified to the applicants.\n\nOn 21 May 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 27 December 2001.\n\nOn 24 June 2002 the president of the Istanbul State Security Court sent the final judgment to the public prosecutor's office at the Istanbul State Security Court and requested that the order for the newspaper's closure be executed.\n\nOn 15 July 2002 two police officers executed the order of closure by way of notification of the order in question to the first applicant.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 73283/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Oğuz Atakan Köseoğlu (“the applicant”), on 1 February 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms A. Tekeli, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 26 May 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Izmir.\n\nThe facts of the case, as presented by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nUntil 1987 the applicant worked as a primary school teacher in Izmir.\n\nOn 30 March 1983 he was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nFrom 30 March 1983 to 30 September 1987, he was suspended from his post on account of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nIn 1984 the Diyarbakır Martial Court convicted the applicant under Article 141 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.\n\nBy a decision of 30 September 1987, the Ministry of National Education dismissed the applicant from his employment. It reasoned that the applicant was no longer eligible for the civil service since he failed to fulfil the requirements of the post as prescribed by Article 48 § A-5 of Law no. 657.\n\nOn 12 April 1991 Article 141 of the Criminal Code was repealed by Law no. 3713 (the Anti-Terror Law).\n\nOn 4 December 1991 the Izmir Assize Court ordered the removal of the applicant's conviction under Article 141 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 15 September 1992 the applicant filed a petition with the administrative authorities and requested his reinstatement to his previous post.\n\nOn 31 December 1993 the applicant was reinstated to the post of primary school teacher at a primary school in Konak.\n\nOn 8 February 1994 the applicant filed a petition with the principal of the primary school. He requested to be given the rights and earnings which he was denied during his suspension and dismissal periods.\n\nThe principal of the primary school transmitted the applicant's petition to the Konak District National Education Directorate.\n\nBy a decision dated 11 April 1994, the Ministry of National Education dismissed the applicant's request.\n\nOn 9 May 1994 the Konak District National Education Directorate informed the applicant about the Ministry's decision.\n\nOn 30 May 1994 the applicant filed an action with the Izmir Administrative Court, seeking compensation for the damage he had suffered as a result of his allegedly unlawful suspension and dismissal. He further requested to be granted the rights and salaries of which he had been deprived during those periods.\n\nOn 20 December 1996 the Izmir Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's claim. It reasoned that the decision of the administrative authorities concerning his reinstatement to his previous post would not enable him to claim the rights and earnings which were denied him during the suspension and dismissal periods.\n\nOn 6 April 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for appeal. It opined that the reinstatement of the applicant did not give him the right to recuperate rights and earnings for the suspension and dismissal period.\n\nOn 31 August 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court's decision was served on the applicant.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nThe facts of the case, as presented by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nUntil [DATE_TIME] the applicant worked as a primary school teacher in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] he was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nFrom [DATE_TIME] to [DATE_TIME], he was suspended from his post on account of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the Diyarbakır Martial Court convicted the applicant under Article 141 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment.\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME], the Ministry of National Education dismissed the applicant from his employment. It reasoned that the applicant was no longer eligible for the civil service since he failed to fulfil the requirements of the post as prescribed by Article 48 § A-5 of Law no. 657.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Article 141 of the Criminal Code was repealed by Law no. 3713 (the Anti-Terror Law).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Izmir Assize Court ordered the removal of the applicant's conviction under Article 141 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed a petition with the administrative authorities and requested his reinstatement to his previous post.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was reinstated to the post of primary school teacher at a primary school in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed a petition with the principal of the primary school. He requested to be given the rights and earnings which he was denied during his suspension and dismissal periods.\n\nThe principal of the primary school transmitted the applicant's petition to the Konak District National Education Directorate.\n\nBy a decision dated [DATE_TIME], the Ministry of National Education dismissed the applicant's request.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Konak District National Education Directorate informed the applicant about the Ministry's decision.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed an action with the Izmir Administrative Court, seeking compensation for the damage he had suffered as a result of his allegedly unlawful suspension and dismissal. He further requested to be granted the rights and salaries of which he had been deprived during those periods.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Izmir Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's claim. It reasoned that the decision of the administrative authorities concerning his reinstatement to his previous post would not enable him to claim the rights and earnings which were denied him during the suspension and dismissal periods.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for appeal. It opined that the reinstatement of the applicant did not give him the right to recuperate rights and earnings for the suspension and dismissal period.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court's decision was served on the applicant.",

The applicants were represented by Mr A.F. Demirkan, a lawyer practising in Bursa. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 12 June 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1952, 1960, 1962 and 1934 respectively and live in Bursa.\n\nIn 2004 the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicants without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicants brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of their property. They requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved their right to increase this claim in due course.\n\nOn 22 June 2006 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of their land, as requested, plus interest. The applicants initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. 2009/2802).\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nThe applicants subsequently brought an additional action (“ek dava”) before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain further compensation for their land in the light of the expert report obtained during the previous proceedings, which had valued the land at a rate higher than that initially requested by them.\n\nOn 24 May 2007 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 126,725, plus interest. The applicants initiated another set of execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain the amount awarded (file no. 2007/6192).\n\nOn 16 October 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Karacabey Civil Court.\n\nOn 23 March and 13 November 2009 the administration paid TRY 8,821 and 187,447 respectively to the files before the Bursa Execution Office.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the applicants, there has been no outstanding debt in the execution files.",

The applicants were represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] respectively and live in [LOCATION].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicants without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicants brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of their property. They requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved their right to increase this claim in due course.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of their land, as requested, plus interest. The applicants initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. [DATE_TIME]).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nThe applicants subsequently brought an additional action (“ek dava”) before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain further compensation for their land in the light of the expert report obtained during the previous proceedings, which had valued the land at a rate higher than that initially requested by them.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 126,725, plus interest. The applicants initiated another set of execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain the amount awarded (file no. 2007/6192).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Karacabey Civil Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the administration paid TRY 8,821 and 187,447 respectively to the files before the Bursa Execution Office.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the applicants, there has been no outstanding debt in the execution files.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in three applications (nos. 28152/02 and 28155/02 and 28156/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Nezir Demirhan, Mr Mehdi Görsav and Mr Fırat Çelik (“the applicants”), on 18 June 2002.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr Sedat Çınar, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicants complained that the non-enforcement of court decisions in their favour had given rise to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nOn 12 September 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the applications. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are all Turkish nationals and live in Diyarbakır.\n\nUntil 4 May 1999 the applicants were employed as manual workers by the Diyarbakır Sur Municipality (“the Municipality”). On that date, the Municipality discharged 153 employees, including the applicants, without paying their wages, a dismissal indemnity or any other pecuniary rights to which they were entitled pursuant to domestic labour law.\n\nOn 2 June 1999 the applicants brought separate actions for compensation against the Municipality before the Diyarbakır Labour Court.\n\nOn 11 November 1999 the court ruled in their favour and ordered the Municipality to pay 743,859,795 Turkish liras (TRL)0 to Mr Demirhan, TRL 1,000,000,0000 to Mr Görsav and TRL 774,821,7950 to Mr Çelik, plus statutory interest running from 2 June 1999. It also ruled that the legal costs and expenses of the proceedings should be borne by the Municipality.\n\nIn the absence of an appeal, the judgments became final on 11 November 1999.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the applicants initiated enforcement proceedings against the Municipality. However, their efforts proved futile as the Municipality refused to comply with the judgments.\n\nOn 15 February 2001 and 21 March 2001 the applicants' representative requested the Diyarbakır Governor's Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs to intervene on their behalf in order to facilitate the enforcement of the court's judgments.\n\nOn 9 May 2001 the Diyarbakır Governor's Office informed the applicants' representative that they had written to the Municipality requesting them to redress the applicants' grievances. However, the Municipality did not make any payment since it was underfunded.\n\nOn 20 June 2002 Mr Mehdi Görsav reached a friendly settlement agreement with the Municipality. The friendly settlement protocol stipulated that the applicant would waive all of his claims, including the principal amount of compensation determined by the Labour Court, interest and all costs and fees, if he were to be paid TRL 1,025,815,000. The protocol also stated the applicant would receive this sum in five instalments. Between 27 June 2002 and 21 November 2002 this amount was paid to the applicant.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Fırat Çelik initiated enforcement proceedings in order to recover his compensation. However, on 19 December 2002 his case was struck out by the enforcement office since he did not pursue his application.\n\nBy letters dated 6 January 2005 the Municipality invited Mr Fırat Çelik and Mr Nezir Demirhan to receive within seven days the principal amount awarded by the Labour Court. However, the applicants declined the invitation since the sum offered did not cover the interest, costs and fees awarded by the Labour Court.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in three applications (nos. 28152/02 and 28155/02 and 28156/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three [NRP] nationals, Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] (“the applicants”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicants complained that the non-enforcement of court decisions in their favour had given rise to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the applications. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are all [NRP] nationals and live in [LOCATION].\n\nUntil [DATE_TIME] the applicants were employed as manual workers by the Diyarbakır Sur Municipality (“the Municipality”). On that date, the Municipality discharged 153 employees, including the applicants, without paying their wages, a dismissal indemnity or any other pecuniary rights to which they were entitled pursuant to domestic labour law.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicants brought separate actions for compensation against the Municipality before the Diyarbakır Labour Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ruled in their favour and ordered the Municipality to pay 743,859,795 Turkish liras ([LOCATION] to Mr [PERSON], TRL 1,000,000,0000 to Mr [PERSON] and TRL 774,821,7950 to Mr [PERSON], plus statutory interest running from [DATE_TIME]. It also ruled that the legal costs and expenses of the proceedings should be borne by the [LOCATION].\n\nIn the absence of an appeal, the judgments became final on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn an unspecified date, the applicants initiated enforcement proceedings against the Municipality. However, their efforts proved futile as the Municipality refused to comply with the judgments.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the applicants' representative requested the Diyarbakır Governor's Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs to intervene on their behalf in order to facilitate the enforcement of the court's judgments.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Diyarbakır Governor's Office informed the applicants' representative that they had written to the Municipality requesting them to redress the applicants' grievances. However, the Municipality did not make any payment since it was underfunded.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Mr [PERSON] reached a friendly settlement agreement with the Municipality. The friendly settlement protocol stipulated that the applicant would waive all of his claims, including the principal amount of compensation determined by the Labour Court, interest and all costs and fees, if he were to be paid TRL 1,025,815,000. The protocol also stated the applicant would receive this sum in five instalments. [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] this amount was paid to the applicant.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr [PERSON] initiated enforcement proceedings in order to recover his compensation. However, on [DATE_TIME] his case was struck out by the enforcement office since he did not pursue his application.\n\nBy letters dated [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] invited Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] to receive within [DATE_TIME] the principal amount awarded by the Labour Court. However, the applicants declined the invitation since the sum offered did not cover the interest, costs and fees awarded by the Labour Court.",

Wołąsiewicz.\n\nOn 16 June 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Jarocin.\n\nOn 20 April 1993 the applicant lodged a petition for a divorce with the Poznań Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki).\n\nThe Poznań Regional Court held hearings on 24 August and 7 October 1993, 13 January and 26 April 1994.\n\nOn 1 June 1994 the court ordered an expert opinion. It was submitted to the court on 29 August 1994.\n\nFurther hearings were held on 15 November 1994, 7 February 1995, 25 April 1995, 10 August 1995, 7 November 1995 and 16 May 1996.\n\nOn 5 June 1996 the applicant specified his claim and accepted that custody rights be granted to his wife.\n\nOn 13 September 1996 the court ordered fresh expert evidence. The court requested the Department of Psychology of the Poznań University to expedite the preparation of the opinion on the applicant's child's emotional development.\n\nOn 21 January 1997 the hearing was adjourned, in order to give the experts more time to prepare the opinion.\n\nOn 24 January 1997 the court requested the Psychology Department to send back the case file and to submit the opinion. The file was sent back on 21 March 1997; however, no opinion was submitted.\n\nOn 21 April 1997 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice about the length of the proceedings. On 3 June 1997 the Ministry of Justice examined the facts and considered that the applicant's complaint was justified.\n\nThe court held further hearings on 26 June 1997, 23 July 1997, 18 September 1997, 24 November 1997, 26 January 1998, 16 March 1998, 20 April 1998, 8 June 1998 and 13 July 1998.\n\nOn 26 August 1998 the applicant sent another letter to the Ministry of Justice complaining about the length of the proceedings. In September 1998 the case was put under the administrative supervision of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Department of Psychology of the Poznań University failed to submit the relevant expert opinion. As a consequence, the court ordered a new expert opinion on 6 October 1998.\n\nOn 4 December 1998, upon the applicant's further complaint, the Ombudsman examined the case and considered the complaint justified. The Ombudsman requested the President of the Poznań Regional Court to take the necessary steps to accelerate the proceedings.\n\nOn 22 February 1999 and 8 March 1999 the court held hearings.\n\nOn 22 March 1999 the Poznań Regional Court gave judgment and dissolved the applicant's marriage. The court awarded parental rights to both parents and ordered that the child's permanent residence be with the applicant.\n\nBoth parties to the proceedings appealed. On 5 November 1999 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals and upheld the first-instance judgment. The judgment was served on the applicant on 7 January 2000.",

Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a petition for a divorce with the Poznań Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki).\n\nThe Poznań Regional Court held hearings on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ordered an expert opinion. It was submitted to the court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nFurther hearings were held on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant specified his claim and accepted that custody rights be granted to his wife.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ordered fresh expert evidence. The court requested the Department of Psychology of the Poznań University to expedite the preparation of the opinion on the applicant's child's emotional development.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the hearing was adjourned, in order to give the experts more time to prepare the opinion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court requested the Psychology Department to send back the case file and to submit the opinion. The file was sent back on [DATE_TIME]; however, no opinion was submitted.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice about the length of the proceedings. On [DATE_TIME] the Ministry of Justice examined the facts and considered that the applicant's complaint was justified.\n\nThe court held further hearings on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant sent another letter to the Ministry of Justice complaining about the length of the proceedings. In [DATE_TIME] the case was put under the administrative supervision of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Department of Psychology of the Poznań University failed to submit the relevant expert opinion. As a consequence, the court ordered a new expert opinion on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], upon the applicant's further complaint, the Ombudsman examined the case and considered the complaint justified. The Ombudsman requested the President of the Poznań Regional Court to take the necessary steps to accelerate the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the court held hearings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Regional Court gave judgment and dissolved the applicant's marriage. The court awarded parental rights to both parents and ordered that the child's permanent residence be with the applicant.\n\nBoth parties to the proceedings appealed. On [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals and upheld the first-instance judgment. The judgment was served on the applicant on [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24322/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Ryszard Panusz (“the applicant”), on 21 October 2001. The applicant was represented by Ms S. Kałka, a lawyer practising in Racibórz.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 6 October 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Katowice.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn 28 June 2000 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn 30 June 2000 the Tychy District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered his detention on remand.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on 28 September, 18 December 2000 and on 26 March 2001.\n\nOn 8 June 2001 the bill of indictment was lodged.\n\nOn 25 June 2001 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 15 January 2002. The court relied on a strong suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, which was supported by evidence. It attached importance to the grave nature of the offence and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on him. In addition, keeping him in custody was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. Lastly, the court stressed that there were 3 co‑accused and 26 witnesses involved in the proceedings.\n\nOn 16 November 2001 the trial court held the first hearing. It subsequently held 7 hearings in the case.\n\nOn 7 January 2002 the Katowice Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 15 May 2002. The court repeated the reasons given previously. Upon an appeal by the applicant, the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) upheld that decision on 6 February 2002.\n\nOn 6 May 2002 the Regional Court again extended the applicant’s detention. The court stressed that he was likely to receive a particularly severe sentence.\n\nOn 23 May 2002 the Katowice Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment. On 10 July 2002 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal. He was kept in detention pending appeal for the 10 subsequent months.\n\nOn 6 March 2003 the Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment.\n\nOn 18 June 2003 the applicant’s lawyer filed a cassation appeal (kasacja) with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nOn 24 May 2004 the applicant informed the Registry that his cassation appeal had been rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nB. Monitoring of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nAt the time of lodging his application with the Court the applicant was detained in the course of criminal proceedings against him.\n\nOn 1 February 2002 the Registry of the Court received a letter from the applicant dated 28 January 2002. The envelope bears a stamp “censored on...” (ocenzurowano dn....) and an illegible signature.\n\nOn 28 May 2002 the Registry of the Court received the application form from the applicant (dated 16 May 2002). It was delivered in an envelope bearing a stamp “censored on...” (ocenzurowano dn....). It also bears an illegible signature and a handwritten date, 20 May 2002.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24322/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME]. The applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court ([PERSON]) ordered his detention on remand.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the bill of indictment was lodged.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. The court relied on a strong suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, which was supported by evidence. It attached importance to the grave nature of the offence and the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on him. In addition, keeping him in custody was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. Lastly, the court stressed that there were 3 co‑accused and 26 witnesses involved in the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court held the first hearing. It subsequently held 7 hearings in the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. The court repeated the reasons given previously. Upon an appeal by the applicant, the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) upheld that decision on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court again extended the applicant’s detention. The court stressed that he was likely to receive a particularly severe sentence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal. He was kept in detention pending appeal for [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s lawyer filed a cassation appeal (kasacja) with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant informed the Registry that his cassation appeal had been rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nB. Monitoring of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nAt the time of lodging his application with the Court the applicant was detained in the course of criminal proceedings against him.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Registry of the Court received a letter from the applicant dated [DATE_TIME]. The envelope bears a stamp “censored on...” (ocenzurowano dn....) and an illegible signature.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Registry of the Court received the application form from the applicant (dated [DATE_TIME]). It was delivered in an envelope bearing a stamp “censored on...” (ocenzurowano dn....). It also bears an illegible signature and a handwritten date, [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 6214/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Edmund Kranz (“the applicant”), on 29 January 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and subsequently Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 10 September 2002 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. It also gave priority to application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1919 and lives in Bydgoszcz, Poland.\n\nOn 19 July 1966 the applicant and his wife obtained a divorce decree. On 5 November 1975 the applicant's ex-wife filed with the Bydgoszcz District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a petition for division of the matrimonial property. On 16 October 1978 the Bydgoszcz District Court gave a decision. Both parties appealed. On 30 May 1979 the Bydgoszcz Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case. In 1982 the applicant's ex-wife donated her share in the disputed property to A.H. and E.H., who became parties to the proceedings.\n\nOn 2 December 1990 the applicant sent a letter to the Minister of Justice, complaining about the slow progress of the proceedings. On 15 February 1991, in reply to his complaints, the President of the Bydgoszcz Regional Court acknowledged that the proceedings were indeed lengthy. Prior to 1 May 1993, the Bydgoszcz District Court held a number of hearings and obtained several expert reports.\n\nOn 19 July 1993 the District Court held a hearing. On 5 January 1994 the applicant challenged the impartiality of the presiding judge.\n\nOn 29 May 1995 the District Court ordered that expert evidence be obtained. On 23 October 1995 the expert informed the court that he had been unable to prepare a report due to the applicant's conduct.\n\nOn 6 September and 23 October 1995 the trial court held inspections of the site.\n\nOn 2 October 1996 the Bydgoszcz District Court gave a decision. The court granted ownership of the entire property (plot of land and the house) to A.H. and E.H. The court also ordered them to pay off the applicant's share in the estate.\n\nOn 5 June 1997, on the applicant's appeal, the Bydgoszcz Regional Court partly amended the first-instance decision. On 19 September 1997 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal.\n\nOn 4 February 1998 A.H. and E.H. sold their share in the property to a certain J.S. On 28 April 1999 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) quashed the decision of 5 June 1997 and remitted the case to the Bydgoszcz Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nOn 27 January 2000 the Bydgoszcz Regional Court gave a decision and remitted the case to the District Court.\n\nOn 20 December 2000 the Bydgoszcz District Court issued an interim order allowing the applicant to install central heating in his part of the house. On 25 June 2001, upon an appeal by J.S., the Bydgoszcz Regional Court quashed this decision.\n\nOn 21 January 2001 the District Court held a hearing.\n\nThe proceedings are pending before the Bydgoszcz District Court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 16160/90) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mr Christos Saveriades (“the applicant”), on 26 January 1990.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr C. Clerides and Mr A. Demetriades, two lawyers practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived him of his home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 26 September 2002 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant was born in Peristerona, a village in the District of Famagusta in northern Cyprus. He lived in Famagusta with his family in a four-bedroom apartment with an unobstructed view towards the sea, which he claimed that he owned. This apartment, located at no. 128 of the commercial and touristic main street named Kennedy Avenue, was indicated by no. 703 on a building erected upon a building site with plot no. 937 of block C and sheet/plan 33/21.2.3. It was registered in the name of the applicant under registration no. 1057.\n\nThe applicant further claimed that at the time of the 1974 Turkish invasion he was the owner of land in Famagusta on which was located an Intercommunal Secondary Grammar school, known as the “Centre of Higher Studies”. This land covered a total area of 6,299 m², on plot no. 900 of block D and sheet/plan 24/59W2. It was registered in the name of the applicant under registration no. D-4840. On this land the applicant had erected a three-storey building, which had a total area of 2,020 m², comprising a basement, ground floor and two vertical floors above it. The applicant submitted that he was the owner and headmaster of the above-mentioned school, the premises of which are now part of the “Eastern Mediterranean University”.\n\nIn support of his claims to ownership, the applicant produced the following documents:\n\nan agreement reached on 1 September 1968 between a certain G. Nicolaides and Mr Takis Saveriades (a member of the applicant's family) for the sale of an apartment located on the seventh floor of a flat on the Famagusta coast;\n\na certificate issued on 28 November 2002 by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus stating that the applicant was the owner of a flat without parking space, located in Famagusta, Kennedy Avenue, registered under plot no. 937, sheet/plan 3/21.2.3;\n\na certificate issued on 11 September 2001 by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus stating that the applicant was the owner of a field with an unregistered building, located in Famagusta, Salaminas Avenue, registered under plot no. 900, sheet/plan 24/59;\n\na building permit issued on 11 September 1963 concerning plot no. 900, sheet/plan 24/59\n\nAt the time of the 1974 Turkish invasion, the applicant and his family fled to southern Cyprus. He claimed that since then he had been deprived of his property rights, all his property being located in the area which is under the occupation and the control of the Turkish military authorities. The latter prevented him from having access to and from using and possessing his home and property in Famagusta as well as from practising his profession there.",

Clerides and [PERSON], two lawyers practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON].\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the [NRP] occupation of the northern part of [LOCATION] had deprived him of his home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nThe applicant was born in [LOCATION], a village in [LOCATION] in northern [LOCATION]. He lived in [LOCATION] with his family in a four-bedroom apartment with an unobstructed view towards the sea, which he claimed that he owned. This apartment, located at no. 128 of the commercial and touristic main street named [LOCATION], was indicated by no. 703 on a building erected upon a building site with plot no. 937 of block C and sheet/plan 33/21.2.3. It was registered in the name of the applicant under registration no. 1057.\n\nThe applicant further claimed that at the time of the [DATE_TIME] [NRP] invasion he was the owner of land in [LOCATION] on which was located an Intercommunal Secondary Grammar school, known as the “Centre of Higher Studies”. This land covered a total area of 6,299 m², on plot no. 900 of block D and sheet/plan 24/59W2. It was registered in the name of the applicant under registration no. D-4840. On this land the applicant had erected a three-storey building, which had a total area of 2,020 m², comprising a basement, ground floor and two vertical floors above it. The applicant submitted that he was the owner and headmaster of the above-mentioned school, the premises of which are now part of the “Eastern Mediterranean University”.\n\nIn support of his claims to ownership, the applicant produced the following documents:\n\nan agreement reached on [DATE_TIME] between a certain [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] (a member of the applicant's family) for the sale of an apartment located on the seventh floor of a flat on the [LOCATION] coast;\n\na certificate issued on [DATE_TIME] by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus stating that the applicant was the owner of a flat without parking space, located in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], registered under plot no. 937, sheet/plan [DATE_TIME].2.3;\n\na certificate issued on [DATE_TIME] by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus stating that the applicant was the owner of a field with an unregistered building, located in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], registered under plot no. 900, sheet/plan 24/59;\n\na building permit issued on [DATE_TIME] concerning plot no. 900, sheet/plan 24/59\n\nAt the time of the [DATE_TIME] [NRP] invasion, the applicant and his family fled to southern [LOCATION]. He claimed that since then he had been deprived of his property rights, all his property being located in the area which is under the occupation and the control of the [NRP] military authorities. The latter prevented him from having access to and from using and possessing his home and property in [LOCATION] as well as from practising his profession there.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 2065/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Barbara Warsicka.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The applicant was represented by Mr J. Hajduk, a lawyer practising in Zielona Góra.\n\nOn 26 September 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, the owner of real property which she had been renting, filed a civil action for damages against the tenant. On 4 September 2000 her action was dismissed by a judgment of the Zielona Góra Regional Court. The applicant appealed against the judgment. On 19 June 2001 her appeal was dismissed by a judgment of the Poznań Court of Appeal. Judge S. G. was the judge rapporteur in the case.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment through a panel of the Poznań Court of Appeal. On 22 October 2001 her cassation appeal was rejected by a decision of that panel. In its written grounds for the decision, the panel stated that the cassation appeal did not comply with a procedural requirement set out in Article 393 3 § 1 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure in that it did not include “arguments showing that its examination [by the Supreme Court] would be justified” within the meaning of this provision (see paragraphs 14-16 below). The mere fact that the cassation appeal contained arguments to show the grounds on which it had been lodged was insufficient for the appeal to be declared admissible. The panel further stated that this shortcoming was serious and as such could not be remedied. Judge S.G. presided over the panel which gave this decision and also acted as the judge rapporteur on the admissibility issue.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the decision of 22 October 2001, challenging inter alia the composition of the court. She submitted that the fact that the same judge had sat on a panel giving a second-instance judgment on the merits and subsequently on a panel rejecting a cassation appeal against that judgment rendered the proceedings unfair.\n\nOn 7 March 2002 her appeal was dismissed by a decision of the Supreme Court. The court first noted the case-law of the Supreme Court on the interpretation of Article 393 3 § 1 (3) of the Code. It referred to its numerous judgments to the effect that a shortcoming in a cassation appeal which took the form of a failure to enumerate the circumstances justifying its examination was of a serious and irreparable character, which could not be remedied by requesting the appellant to rectify it. It further noted that this requirement was closely linked to the examination of the grounds on which the Supreme Court could refuse to entertain a cassation appeal, as listed in Article 393 of the Code (see paragraph 18 below), namely if it considered that no significant legal issue arose in the case or where there were no legal issues involved which would give rise to serious doubts or to discrepancies in the case-law.\n\nIt referred to the applicant’s objection in one sentence only: “The fact that the judge, who took part in the judgment against which the cassation appeal was subsequently lodged, participated in a decision by which this appeal was found inadmissible is of no significance”.",

The applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [PERSON].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, the owner of real property which she had been renting, filed a civil action for damages against the tenant. On [DATE_TIME] her action was dismissed by a judgment of the Zielona Góra Regional Court. The applicant appealed against the judgment. On [DATE_TIME] her appeal was dismissed by a judgment of the Poznań Court of Appeal. Judge [PERSON] was the judge rapporteur in the case.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment through a panel of the Poznań Court of Appeal. On [DATE_TIME] her cassation appeal was rejected by a decision of that panel. In its written grounds for the decision, the panel stated that the cassation appeal did not comply with a procedural requirement set out in Article 393 3 § 1 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure in that it did not include “arguments showing that its examination [by the Supreme Court] would be justified” within the meaning of this provision (see paragraphs 14-16 below). The mere fact that the cassation appeal contained arguments to show the grounds on which it had been lodged was insufficient for the appeal to be declared admissible. The panel further stated that this shortcoming was serious and as such could not be remedied. Judge [PERSON] presided over the panel which gave this decision and also acted as the judge rapporteur on the admissibility issue.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against the decision of [DATE_TIME], challenging inter alia the composition of the court. She submitted that the fact that the same judge had sat on a panel giving a second-instance judgment on the merits and subsequently on a panel rejecting a cassation appeal against that judgment rendered the proceedings unfair.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] her appeal was dismissed by a decision of the Supreme Court.

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 53645/10) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Musa Ateşoğlu (“the applicant”), on 2 July 2010.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr O. Gündoğdu, a lawyer practising in Kars. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 29 November 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Kars.\n\nOn 27 April 2002 the applicant, who was seventeen years old at the time, was arrested by police officers in Kars, on suspicion of robbery. On the same day, he was examined by a doctor at the Kars State Hospital, and no signs of injury were reported.\n\nAt the police station, the applicant was allegedly forced to make self-incriminating statements. During his interrogation, the applicant claims that the police officers pulled his ears and he was beaten and subjected to falaka (beating on the soles of his feet).\n\nOn 29 April 2002, following the complaint of the applicant’s representative, the Kars Public Prosecutor went to the police station to see the applicant. According to his report, there were several widespread bruises on the soles of the applicant’s feet and oedema behind his ears. The public prosecutor also noted that the applicant had stated that he had been ill‑treated and that he could identify the police officers who had ill‑treated him. The same day, the applicant identified the four police officers who had ill‑treated him. Following his interrogation by the public prosecutor, the applicant was released.\n\nThe applicant was subsequently taken to the Kars State Hospital for a medical examination. According to the doctor’s report, there were several scars on his left arm, bruises and oedema behind his left ear, and bruises on both of his palms and on the soles of his feet. It was noted that his injuries would heal in five days.\n\nOn 1 May 2002 the Kars Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against four police officers, accusing them of ill-treating the applicant under Article 245 of the former Criminal Code. The applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party.\n\nOn 9 May 2002 the Kars Criminal Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction, holding that the proceedings should be initiated before the Assize Court on account of torture under Article 243 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nThe proceedings therefore resumed before the Kars Assize Court. At the end of the trial, on 15 June 2010 the Kars Assize Court, on the basis of the evidence in the case file, found the police officers guilty of inflicting torture pursuant to Article 243 of the former Criminal Code. The court found it established that the police officers had intentionally ill-treated the applicant to extract a confession. It accordingly sentenced each of the police officers to one year imprisonment under Article 243 of the former Criminal Code, and banned them from public service for six months. Having regard to the good attitude of the police officers during the trial, the court then reduced their sentence to ten months’ imprisonment and five months’ ban from public service. It subsequently suspended the pronouncement of the judgment in accordance with Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 53645/10) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant, who was [DATE_TIME] at the time, was arrested by police officers in [LOCATION], on suspicion of robbery. On [DATE_TIME], he was examined by a doctor at the Kars State Hospital, and no signs of injury were reported.\n\nAt the police station, the applicant was allegedly forced to make self-incriminating statements. During his interrogation, the applicant claims that the police officers pulled his ears and he was beaten and subjected to falaka (beating on the soles of his feet).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], following the complaint of the applicant’s representative, the Kars Public Prosecutor went to the police station to see the applicant. According to his report, there were several widespread bruises on the soles of the applicant’s feet and oedema behind his ears. The public prosecutor also noted that the applicant had stated that he had been ill‑treated and that he could identify the police officers who had ill‑treated him. [DATE_TIME], the applicant identified the four police officers who had ill‑treated him. Following his interrogation by the public prosecutor, the applicant was released.\n\nThe applicant was subsequently taken to the Kars State Hospital for a medical examination. According to the doctor’s report, there were several scars on his left arm, bruises and oedema behind his left ear, and bruises on both of his palms and on the soles of his feet. It was noted that his injuries would heal in [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Kars Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against four police officers, accusing them of ill-treating the applicant under Article 245 of the former Criminal Code. The applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Kars Criminal Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction, holding that the proceedings should be initiated before the Assize Court on account of torture under Article 243 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nThe proceedings therefore resumed before the Kars Assize Court. At the end of the trial, on [DATE_TIME] the Kars Assize Court, on the basis of the evidence in the case file, found the police officers guilty of inflicting torture pursuant to Article 243 of the former Criminal Code. The court found it established that the police officers had intentionally ill-treated the applicant to extract a confession. It accordingly sentenced each of the police officers to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment under Article 243 of the former Criminal Code, and banned them from public service for [DATE_TIME]. Having regard to the good attitude of the police officers during the trial, the court then reduced their sentence to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment and [DATE_TIME] ban from public service. It subsequently suspended the pronouncement of the judgment in accordance with Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Huziuk, a lawyer practising in Łódź, Poland. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and, subsequently, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 3 May 2004 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Łask-Kolumna, Poland.\n\nA. Facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nIn 1983 the applicant was injured in a traffic accident. He was subsequently granted a special disability pension from the State Insurance Company (Powszechny Zakład Ubezpieczeniowy - “PZU”). The applicant was not satisfied with the amount of the pension and on 31 March 1992 he lodged a claim for a reassessment of the amount with the Łask District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). The first hearing was held on 21 April 1993.\n\nB. Facts after 30 April 1993\n\nThe trial court held hearings on 17 May and 28 October 1993. A hearing scheduled for 24 December 1993 was adjourned at the defendant’s request. Subsequently, on 23 March 1994 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 30 March 1994 the Łask District Court gave judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim.\n\nOn 25 August 1994, upon the applicant’s appeal, the Łódź Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case in respect of part of the claims to the Łask District Court.\n\nOn 9 December 1994 the District Court held a hearing.\n\nBetween 3 February 1995 and 15 March 1996 the court held six hearings. A hearing listed for 9 June 1995 was adjourned as the defendant had not been properly summoned. At a hearing held on 30 June 1995 the applicant requested that an expert opinion be obtained. On 9 August 1995 the applicant withdrew his motion concerning matters of evidence. A hearing scheduled for 20 November 1995 was adjourned as the applicant’s lawyer had not been properly summoned.\n\nOn 28 June 1996 the court ordered that expert evidence be obtained. On 17 March 1997 the court urged the expert to submit the opinion. The expert’s report was submitted to the court on 31 December 1997.\n\nSubsequently, hearings were held on 6 February and 4 March 1998. The trial court held four further hearings between 8 April 1998 and 8 February 1999. At a hearing held on 8 April 1998 the court proposed that the parties conclude a friendly settlement. The proposal was rejected. A hearing scheduled for 5 June 1998 was adjourned as both parties failed to appear before the court.\n\nOn 12 February 1999 the District Court gave judgment. Both parties appealed.\n\nOn 30 June 1999 the Sieradz Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s claim.\n\nThe proceedings were terminated by the judgment of the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) of 21 January 2000.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 43837/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Roman Misiak (“the applicant”), on 17 October 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 5 March 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the monitoring of the applicant’s correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Gdańsk.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 9 August 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud and placed in pre-trial detention. The grounds for this decision are unknown, since the applicant has not produced a copy of it.\n\nOn 3 November 2006 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 9 February 2007. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court further found that there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding, given that earlier he could not be found at his place of permanent residence.\n\nThe applicant submitted that he unsuccessfully appealed against decisions extending his detention.\n\nThe applicant maintained that during his arrest he was treated in a degrading manner by police officers and that he was subjected to threats. On 19 February 2007 the Gdańsk District Prosecutor instituted an investigation into the applicant’s complaints against the police officers. The investigation is still continuing.\n\nB.

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 43837/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the monitoring of the applicant’s correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud and placed in pre-trial detention. The grounds for this decision are unknown, since the applicant has not produced a copy of it.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk District Court ([PERSON]) extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court further found that there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding, given that earlier he could not be found at his place of permanent residence.\n\nThe applicant submitted that he unsuccessfully appealed against decisions extending his detention.\n\nThe applicant maintained that during his arrest he was treated in a degrading manner by police officers and that he was subjected to threats. On [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk District Prosecutor instituted an investigation into the applicant’s complaints against the police officers. The investigation is still continuing.\n\nB. Censorship of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nThe applicant submitted that during his detention his correspondence was censored by the authorities. He produced five envelopes. All the envelopes bear a stamp that reads: “Censored, date ..., Prosecutor” (Ocenzurowano, dnia ... Prokurator). Those envelopes contained letters from:\n\nthe Penitentiary Association “Patronat” (Stowarzyszenie Penitencjarne “Patronat”), a non-governmental organisation, acting, inter alia, on behalf of prisoners and former prisoners, sent on [DATE_TIME];\n\nthe Supreme Court, sent on [DATE_TIME];\n\nthe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment, sent on [DATE_TIME];\n\nthe Ministry of Justice; sent on [DATE_TIME];\n\nthe Ombudsman, sent on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant produced one envelope that indicates as the addressee of the letter the Governor of Sztum Prison and bears a stamp that reads: “Censored, date ..., Prosecutor” (Ocenzurowano, dnia ... Prokurator). A hand-written note indicates case file no. IC 119/05.\n\nOne envelope bears traces of having been opened - its sides were cut open and resealed using self-adhesive tape.\n\nThe applicant submitted that a letter addressed to him by the Court had been opened and read by the authorities. In a note sent to the applicant from Sztum Prison ([PERSON]) on [DATE_TIME], he was informed that on [DATE_TIME] a letter from the European Court of Human Rights to the applicant had been delivered by the District Prosecutor’s Office. The note further states that the letter had clearly been damaged.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 28 January 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). It originated in an application (no. 10300/83) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a national of that State, Mrs. Martha Nölkenbockhoff, on 7 February 1983. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Federal Republic of Germany recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Mrs. Nölkenbockhoff stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).\n\nOn 28 January 1986, the President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the Lutz and Englert cases should be considered by the same Chamber (Rule 21 § 6). The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. R. Bernhardt, the elected judge of German nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 19 March 1986, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other five members, namely Mr. F. Matscher, Mr. J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Sir Vincent Evans and Mr. R. Macdonald (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).\n\nAfter assuming the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. Ryssdal consulted, through the Deputy Registrar, the Agent of the German Government (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant on the need for a written procedure. On 2 April, he directed that the Agent and the applicant’s lawyer should have until 1 July 1986 to file memorials and that the Delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within two months (Rule 37 § 1). The President twice extended the first of these time-limits - on 3 July until 31 October, and on 10 November until 21 November 1986.\n\nThe applicant’s memorial - drafted in German, with the President’s leave (Rule 27 § 3) - was lodged with the registry on 1 July 1986 and the Government’s on 19 November.\n\nOn 29 November, the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court (Rule 50).\n\nOn 15 December, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nThe next day, having consulted - through the Deputy Registrar - the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant, the President directed that the oral proceedings should open on 23 February 1987 (Rule 38). On 6 February, he granted the members of the Government’s delegation leave to speak in German (Rule 27 § 2).\n\nThe hearing was held in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mrs. I. Maier, Ministerialdirigentin, Federal Ministry of Justice, Agent, Mr. H. Stöcker, Ministerialrat, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. W. Beitlich, Oberstaatsanwalt, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. A. Weitzel, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr. J. Bergemann, Rechtsanwalt, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mrs. Maier for the Government, by Mr. Weitzel for the Commission and by Mr. Bergemann for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.\n\nOn various dates between 9 February and 22 May 1987, the Commission, the Government and the applicant filed a number of documents and written comments either at the Court’s request or of their own motion.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMrs. Martha Nölkenbockhoff, a German national, is the widow and heir of Mr. Theodor Nölkenbockhoff, who died on 13 November 1981. She lives in Selm-Bork.\n\nHer husband was a senior manager in a holding company, Stumm AG, whose trading activities centred on iron, steel and fuel, including motor fuel. He joined the firm on 1 July 1967 and subsequently held a number of key positions in it. On 25 October 1974, Stumm AG ceased payments by reason of insolvency and asked the Essen District Court (Amtsgericht) to set in motion composition proceedings (Vergleichsverfahren). On 13 November 1974, Mr. Nölkenbockhoff was arrested under a warrant issued by the Essen District Court on 11 November; he was suspected among other things of bankruptcy offences. Other senior managers in the company were also arrested.\n\nOn 17 May 1976, the indictment, which was 489 pages long, was served on Mr. Nölkenbockhoff and four co-defendants. The trial hearings began on 29 October 1976 before the 6th Criminal Chamber (6. Grosse Strafkammer) of the Essen Regional Court (Landgericht). They lasted until 11 July 1980, two or three hearings being held each week. The court heard evidence from hundreds of witnesses, and several thousand documents were read out. The applicant’s husband was defended by two counsel, one of whom was assigned by the court.\n\nOn 11 July 1980, the Regional Court delivered its judgment, which ran to 579 pages. Mr. Nölkenbockhoff was found guilty inter alia on several charges of breach of trust (Untreue), criminal bankruptcy (Bankrott) and fraud (Betrug), and given an aggregate sentence of eight years’ imprisonment. His four co-defendants were also sentenced to prison terms - two of them, for more or less identical offences and a few additional ones, to nine years, nine months and to eight years, six months respectively; the other two, for aiding and abetting, to four years, three months each. In respect of a series of fraud charges, the Regional Court stayed the proceedings under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 23 below); and it acquitted Mr. Nölkenbockhoff and two of his co-defendants on a number of other charges. In determining the sentences, the Regional Court took into account as extenuating circumstances the length of the proceedings and, in respect of the applicant’s husband, his detention on remand for some three years; this period was deducted from the total sentence.\n\nMr. Nölkenbockhoff entered an appeal on points of law on the same day that judgment was given. After receiving the text of the judgment on 5 October 1981, he filed - on 19 October - full pleadings which ran to 735 pages with 94 appendices. The Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) had not given a decision by the time he died on 13 November, so that the proceedings in respect of Mr. Nölkenbockhoff came to an end without any decision being taken on his appeal. Three of the co-defendants, who had likewise challenged the Regional Court’s judgment, later withdrew their appeals on points of law; the appeal lodged by the fourth person convicted, Mr. M, was dismissed by the Federal Court on 7 July 1982 as being manifestly ill-founded.\n\nHaving been arrested and detained on remand on 13 November 1974 (see paragraph 12 above), Mr. Nölkenbockhoff was released on bail at the end of March 1977 in order to undergo a bile-duct operation. He was re-arrested on 21 February 1979 but freed by the Hamm Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) on 23 March 1979, the court holding that there was no valid ground for quashing the March 1977 order suspending execution of the arrest warrant. On 30 April 1980, the Essen Regional Court ordered his re-arrest and, at the same time, the arrest of all the co-defendants; as the public prosecutor had made his final submissions, calling for heavy sentences, the court held that the measures taken to prevent the defendants absconding were no longer sufficient. On 26 June 1981, Mr. Nölkenbockhoff was released on health grounds.\n\nIn written pleadings dated 1 December 1981, the applicant, as her deceased husband’s sole heir, sought orders that the Treasury should bear the necessary costs and expenses (notwendige Auslagen) incurred by her late husband in connection with his conviction by the Regional Court and that the estate should be paid compensation for his detention pending trial. In the alternative, she requested the Regional Court to adjourn a decision on her applications until such time as the Federal Court of Justice had given judgment on the appeal brought by the co-defendant Mr. M. On 5 March 1982, the Essen Regional Court found against Mrs. Nölkenbockhoff. Its decision read as follows: “... The applications are admissible ... but ill-founded. Where proceedings are terminated by reason of a defendant’s death, his necessary costs and expenses are normally borne by the Treasury, but this does not apply where, were it not for this technical bar, the defendant would almost certainly have been convicted or his conviction almost certainly have been upheld (wenn es bei Wegdenken des Verfahrenshindernisses annähernd sicher zu erwarten war, dass es zur Verurteilung des Angeklagten gekommen bzw. bei einer Verurteilung geblieben wäre). This was so in the instant case. The defendant had already been found guilty, in a judgment that had not become final, after lengthy court proceedings in a trial (Hauptverhandlung) lasting more than three and a half years. The judgment convicting the three co-defendants ..., who were likewise sentenced to several years’ imprisonment, has become final. The co-defendant M is maintaining his appeal on points of law. The submissions made by the defence in its full pleadings afford no reason to suppose that the defendant would have been acquitted had the proceedings continued. The pleas alleging procedural defects (formelle Rügen) - even assuming them to be well-founded - would have been material to the decision to be taken in the instant case only if, in the event of a new trial, a different verdict on the merits would have been expected, that is to say an acquittal. The fact that [three of] the defendants ... have withdrawn their appeals on points of law, thereby confirming the judgment against them, argues decisively in favour of the correctness (materielle Richtigkeit) of the judgment. As to the plea alleging a breach of substantive law (materielle Rüge), the defence’s submissions again provide nothing to support the hypothesis that the proceedings were moving towards an acquittal. The quotations from the trial court’s judgment are taken out of context, do not cover the considerations (Erörterungen) subsequently set out by that court in the reasons for its judgment and are accordingly not consistent with its assessment of the case as a whole. For the same reasons the court declines to award compensation for the time spent in detention on remand, pursuant to section 6(1)(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act (Gesetz über die Entschädigung für Strafverfolgungsmassnahmen) [see paragraph 26 below]. Nor, to the extent that the proceedings were provisionally stayed under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [see paragraph 23 below], are there any grounds for ordering the Treasury to pay the defendant’s necessary costs and expenses, because in view of the reasons given for the judgment, it was much more likely, having regard to the adverse financial position of the Stumm holding company, that if the proceedings had continued, the defendant would have been convicted on the counts in question (weil nach den Ausführungen im Urteil es bei der ungünstigen wirtschaftlichen Situation des Stummkonzerns bei einer Fortsetzung des Verfahrens wesentlich wahrscheinlicher war, dass es insoweit zu einer Verurteilung des Angeklagten gekommen wäre). That being so, the court does not consider it necessary to defer judgment until a decision has been given on the co-defendant M’s appeal on points of law. ....“\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Hamm Court of Appeal against that decision on 11 March 1982. In written pleadings dated 18 March, she challenged, inter alia, the Regional Court’s finding that, had her husband not died, he “would almost certainly have been convicted or his conviction almost certainly have been upheld“. She claimed that that statement was erroneous and infringed the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) and Article 5 (paragraphs 1 and 3) (art. 5-1, art. 5-3) and Article 6 (paragraphs 1 and 2) (art. 6-1, art. 6-2) of the Convention. The court caused the conviction to “become final“ posthumously, thereby prejudicing her as the defendant’s widow with regard to the rights relied on and, in particular, entailing a violation of Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention. It was as if it were sought to obtain a final (abschliessend) conviction of the deceased by a side wind in the form of a decision as to costs although no final (rechtskräftig) judgment had been handed down confirming that he had committed the offences with which he was charged. The Regional Court likewise disregarded the presumption of innocence in stating that the grounds of appeal afforded no reason to suppose that the defendant would have been acquitted. It ought at most to have decided, after a summary examination of the case, that the appeal on points of law had some prospects of success, or it should have refrained from expressing a view. It was precisely for that reason that the applicant had requested an adjournment to await the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice in the appeal proceedings brought by one of the co-defendants. The court, however, had prejudged the Federal Court’s decision by holding that the plea alleging a breach of substantive law again provided nothing to support the hypothesis of an acquittal: the court should have known that vital points in Mr. Nölkenbockhoff’s appeal were also relied on by the co-defendant M. The applicant pointed out in addition that from the outset her husband had denied having committed any offences and had indeed been acquitted on several counts. In the light, inter alia, of Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention, it therefore had to be assumed that in the event of a new trial he would have been acquitted completely. Since criminal law was based on the principle of individual guilt, it was quite simply unacceptable - and, once again, contrary to Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) - to judge the deceased by the conduct of three of the co-defendants. In any case, the fact that those co-defendants had withdrawn their appeals on points of law could not be regarded as an admission of guilt; besides, they had held responsibilities within Stumm AG different from those of her husband.\n\nThe public prosecutor’s office in Bochum and the principal public prosecutor’s office (Generalstaatsanwaltsschaft) at the Hamm Court of Appeal, to which Mrs. Nölkenbockhoff’s appeal (sofortige Beschwerde) had been forwarded for any comments, contended that the appeal should be dismissed. On 28 December 1981, the Bochum public prosecutor submitted that, having regard to the state of the proceedings, there was every likelihood (hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit) that the conviction would have been upheld. The principal public prosecutor gave his opinion on 11 June 1982. He considered that an assessment of the likely outcome of the proceedings (Prüfung des mutmasslichen Verfahrensausgangs), having regard to the reasons given in the judgment of the Essen Regional Court and the grounds of the appeal on points of law, could lead to only one conclusion. It could be assumed - and, indeed, had to be - that if the proceedings had been continued, the defendant’s conviction would have been upheld. The principal public prosecutor took the view that the outcome of the appeal brought by the co-defendant M and still pending before the Federal Court of Justice was of some relevance in assessing the likely outcome of the proceedings concerning Mr. Nölkenbockhoff, who, according to the aforementioned judgment, had committed his various offences in concert (Mittäterschaft) with the said co-defendant.\n\nThe applicant, to whom the public prosecutors’ observations had been communicated, replied on 6 July 1982. She stated, inter alia, that there were considerable dissimilarities between M and her husband as regards the charges against them, their behaviour and the grounds of their appeals; and as evidence of this she pointed to the indictment, the judgment convicting the defendants, and the appeals.\n\nThe Hamm Court of Appeal dismissed the action on 14 July 1982. It left open the question whether, in the event of a defendant’s death before the final conclusion (rechtskräftiger Abschluss) of criminal proceedings, a decision such as that sought by Mrs. Nölkenbockhoff could be taken, by analogy, under Article 467 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 6(1)(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act (see paragraphs 24-26 below). And it added: “Even assuming such decisions are possible (Zulässigkeit), the assessment of the probable outcome of the trial, which must be made in both instances, leads to the conclusion that if the proceedings had been pursued until a final decision was handed down, the former defendant’s conviction would almost certainly (mit annähernder Sicherheit) have been upheld. In order to avoid repetition, reference is made to the reasons given for the contested decision, which are valid (zutreffend). It should be noted in addition that the appeal on points of law of the co-defendant M was subsequently dismissed, on 7 July 1982, by the Federal Court of Justice ... as being manifestly ill-founded. That fact is of particular importance in assessing the prospects of success which ... Mr. Nölkenbockhoff’s appeal would have had, because according to the reasons given for the judgment of 11 July 1980, the offences of which [he] was convicted at first instance were committed together with ... M. ....“ On 2 September 1982, the Court of Appeal rejected the objections (Gegenvorstellungen) which the applicant had lodged against the judgment of 14 July 1982.\n\nMrs. Nölkenbockhoff then applied to the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), claiming a breach of Article 1 § 1 (protection of the dignity of man), Article 14 § 1 (the right of property) and Article 20 § 3 (principle of the rule of law) of the Basic Law. On 30 September 1982, a bench of three judges of the Constitutional Court refused to entertain the constitutional complaint because it considered that the complaint did not have sufficient prospects of success. The reasons for its decision were as follows: “1. The presumption of innocence, which is founded on the principle of the rule of law, precludes treating as guilty a person who has not been finally (rechtskräftig) convicted. That does not mean, however, that in every case costs must be reimbursed where the proceedings are terminated without guilt having been established (Schuldnachweis) ...\n\nThe refusal of the applications for an order that the Treasury should bear the deceased defendant’s necessary costs and expenses is based on Article 467 § 3, second sentence, sub-paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The decision on the claim for compensation is based on section 6(1)(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act. Both provisions, whose conformity with the Constitution cannot be doubted, confer on the courts a degree of discretion. There is nothing to suggest that the courts exercised their discretion in a manner contrary to the Constitution. (a) Admittedly, the decisions being challenged make a prediction of the probable outcome of the proceedings had they been continued. However, such an assessment does not amount to a finding of guilt but merely to a finding of a continuing state of suspicion (Eine derartige Einschätzung enthält indessen nicht die Feststellung einer Schuld, sondern lediglich die Feststellung einer fortbestehenden Verdachtslage). Consequently, it does not offend the presumption of innocence. (b) Nor was the prediction of the outcome of the proceedings arbitrary in nature. (aa) Neither the alleged defects ... in the judgment convicting the defendant nor the grounds of the appeal on points of law make it possible to dismiss as untenable the conclusion reached in the contested decisions that a (subsequent) acquittal was unlikely in respect of each of the offences of which the deceased defendant had been convicted. That was the only relevant issue for the order as to costs. The courts’ reference to the lack of success of the appeal proceedings instituted by the co-defendant M and to the withdrawal of the appeals on points of law entered by the other defendants is clearly to be regarded merely as an additional argument, and the impugned decisions are not based on it. (bb) Nor do the grounds advanced in support of the constitutional complaint show the unreasonableness of the Regional Court’s opinion that, had the proceedings been continued, a conviction would have been more likely than an acquittal ... [in connection with the charge in respect of which the proceedings had been provisionally stayed] ... ....“",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on [DATE_TIME], within the [DATE_TIME] period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention“). It originated in an application (no. 10300/83) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a national of that State, Mrs. [PERSON], on [DATE_TIME]. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and [DATE_TIME] (art. [DATE_TIME], art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Federal Republic of Germany recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Mrs. [PERSON] stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the [PERSON] and Englert cases should be considered by the same Chamber (Rule 21 § 6). The Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. [PERSON], the elected judge of [NRP] nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. [PERSON], the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On [DATE_TIME], in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other five members, namely Mr. [PERSON], Mr. [PERSON], Mr. L.-E. [PERSON], Sir [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).\n\nAfter assuming the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. [PERSON] consulted, through the Deputy Registrar, the Agent of the German Government (“the Government“), the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant on the need for a written procedure. On [DATE_TIME], he directed that the Agent and the applicant’s lawyer should have until [DATE_TIME] to file memorials and that the Delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within [DATE_TIME] (Rule 37 § 1). The President twice extended the first of these time-limits - on [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME], and on [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant’s memorial - drafted in [NRP], with the President’s leave (Rule 27 § 3) - was lodged with the registry on [DATE_TIME] and the Government’s on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court (Rule 50).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\n[DATE_TIME], having consulted - through the Deputy Registrar - the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant, the President directed that the oral proceedings should open on [DATE_TIME] (Rule 38). On [DATE_TIME], he granted the members of the Government’s delegation leave to speak in [NRP] (Rule 27 § 2).\n\nThe hearing was held in public in the Human Rights Building, [LOCATION], on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mrs. [PERSON], Ministerialdirigentin, Federal Ministry of Justice, Agent, Mr. [PERSON], Ministerialrat, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. [PERSON], Oberstaatsanwalt, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr. [PERSON], Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr. [PERSON], Rechtsanwalt, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mrs. [PERSON] for the Government, by Mr. [PERSON] for the Commission and by Mr. [PERSON] for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.\n\nOn various dates between [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the Commission, the Government and the applicant filed a number of documents and written comments either at the Court’s request or of their own motion.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMrs. [PERSON], a [NRP] national, is the widow and heir of Mr. [PERSON], who died on [DATE_TIME]. She lives in [PERSON].\n\nHer husband was a senior manager in a holding company, Stumm AG, whose trading activities centred on iron, steel and fuel, including motor fuel. He joined the firm on [DATE_TIME] and subsequently held a number of key positions in it. On [DATE_TIME], Stumm AG ceased payments by reason of insolvency and asked the Essen District Court ([PERSON]) to set in motion composition proceedings ([PERSON]). On [DATE_TIME], Mr. [PERSON] was arrested under a warrant issued by the Essen District Court on [DATE_TIME]; he was suspected among other things of bankruptcy offences. Other senior managers in the company were also arrested.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the indictment, which was 489 pages long, was served on Mr. [PERSON] and four co-defendants. The trial hearings began on [DATE_TIME] before the 6th Criminal Chamber (6. [PERSON]) of the Essen Regional Court (Landgericht). They lasted until [DATE_TIME], two or three hearings being held [DATE_TIME]. The court heard evidence from hundreds of witnesses, and several thousand documents were read out. The applicant’s husband was defended by two counsel, one of whom was assigned by the court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the Regional Court delivered its judgment, which ran to 579 pages. Mr. [PERSON] was found guilty inter alia on several charges of breach of trust (Untreue), criminal bankruptcy (Bankrott) and fraud (Betrug), and given an aggregate sentence of [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. His four co-defendants were also sentenced to prison terms - two of them, for more or less identical offences and a few additional ones, to [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] respectively; the other two, for aiding and abetting, to [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] each. In respect of a series of fraud charges, the Regional Court stayed the proceedings under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 23 below); and it acquitted Mr. [PERSON] and two of his co-defendants on a number of other charges. In determining the sentences, the Regional Court took into account as extenuating circumstances the length of the proceedings and, in respect of the applicant’s husband, his detention on remand for [DATE_TIME]; this period was deducted from the total sentence.\n\nMr. [PERSON] entered an appeal on points of law on [DATE_TIME] that judgment was given. After receiving the text of the judgment on [DATE_TIME], he filed - on [DATE_TIME] pleadings which ran to 735 pages with 94 appendices. The Federal Court of Justice ([NRP]) had not given a decision by the time he died on [DATE_TIME], so that the proceedings in respect of Mr. [PERSON] came to an end without any decision being taken on his appeal. Three of the co-defendants, who had likewise challenged the Regional Court’s judgment, later withdrew their appeals on points of law; the appeal lodged by the fourth person convicted, Mr. [PERSON], was dismissed by the Federal Court on [DATE_TIME] as being manifestly ill-founded.\n\nHaving been arrested and detained on remand on [DATE_TIME] (see paragraph 12 above), Mr. [PERSON] was released on bail at [DATE_TIME] in order to undergo a bile-duct operation. He was re-arrested on [DATE_TIME] but freed by the Hamm Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) on [DATE_TIME], the court holding that there was no valid ground for quashing the [DATE_TIME] order suspending execution of the arrest warrant. On [DATE_TIME], the Essen Regional Court ordered his re-arrest and, at the same time, the arrest of all the co-defendants; as the public prosecutor had made his final submissions, calling for heavy sentences, the court held that the measures taken to prevent the defendants absconding were no longer sufficient. On [DATE_TIME], Mr. [PERSON] was released on health grounds.\n\nIn written pleadings dated [DATE_TIME], the applicant, as her deceased husband’s sole heir, sought orders that the Treasury should bear the necessary costs and expenses (notwendige Auslagen) incurred by her late husband in connection with his conviction by the Regional Court and that the estate should be paid compensation for his detention pending trial. In the alternative, she requested the Regional Court to adjourn a decision on her applications until such time as the Federal Court of Justice had given judgment on the appeal brought by the co-defendant Mr. [PERSON] On [DATE_TIME], the Essen Regional Court found against Mrs. [PERSON]. Its decision read as follows: “... The applications are admissible ... but ill-founded. Where proceedings are terminated by reason of a defendant’s death, his necessary costs and expenses are normally borne by the Treasury, but this does not apply where, were it not for this technical bar, the defendant would almost certainly have been convicted or his conviction almost certainly have been upheld ([PERSON] des Verfahrenshindernisses annähernd sicher zu erwarten war, [PERSON] gekommen bzw. [PERSON]). This was so in the instant case. The defendant had already been found guilty, in a judgment that had not become final, after lengthy court proceedings in a trial ([LOCATION]) lasting more than three and a half years. The judgment convicting the three co-defendants ..., who were likewise sentenced to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment, has become final. The co-defendant M is maintaining his appeal on points of law. The submissions made by the defence in its full pleadings afford no reason to suppose that the defendant would have been acquitted had the proceedings continued. The pleas alleging procedural defects ([PERSON]) - even assuming them to be well-founded - would have been material to the decision to be taken in the instant case only if, in the event of a new trial, a different verdict on the merits would have been expected, that is to say an acquittal. The fact that [three of] the defendants ... have withdrawn their appeals on points of law, thereby confirming the judgment against them, argues decisively in favour of the correctness (materielle [PERSON]) of the judgment. As to the plea alleging a breach of substantive law (materielle Rüge), the defence’s submissions again provide nothing to support the hypothesis that the proceedings were moving towards an acquittal. The quotations from the trial court’s judgment are taken out of context, do not cover the considerations (Erörterungen) subsequently set out by that court in the reasons for its judgment and are accordingly not consistent with its assessment of the case as a whole. For the same reasons the court declines to award compensation for the time spent in detention on remand, pursuant to section 6(1)(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act ([NRP] über die [PERSON] für [LOCATION]) [see paragraph 26 below]. Nor, to the extent that the proceedings were provisionally stayed under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [see paragraph 23 below], are there any grounds for ordering the Treasury to pay the defendant’s necessary costs and expenses, because in view of the reasons given for the judgment, it was much more likely, having regard to the adverse financial position of the Stumm holding company, that if the proceedings had continued, the defendant would have been convicted on the counts in question ([PERSON] im [LOCATION] der [PERSON] wirtschaftlichen Situation des Stummkonzerns bei einer [PERSON] des Verfahrens wesentlich wahrscheinlicher war, [PERSON] zu einer Verurteilung des Angeklagten gekommen wäre). That being so, the court does not consider it necessary to defer judgment until a decision has been given on the co-defendant [PERSON]’s appeal on points of law. ....“\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Hamm Court of Appeal against that decision on [DATE_TIME]. In written pleadings dated [DATE_TIME], she challenged, inter alia, the Regional Court’s finding that, had her husband not died, he “would almost certainly have been convicted or his conviction almost certainly have been upheld“. She claimed that that statement was erroneous and infringed the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) and Article 5 (paragraphs 1 and 3) (art. 5-1, art. 5-3) and Article 6 (paragraphs 1 and 2) (art. 6-1, art. 6-2) of the Convention. The court caused the conviction to “become final“ posthumously, thereby prejudicing her as the defendant’s widow with regard to the rights relied on and, in particular, entailing a violation of Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention. It was as if it were sought to obtain a final (abschliessend) conviction of the deceased by a side wind in the form of a decision as to costs although no final (rechtskräftig) judgment had been handed down confirming that he had committed the offences with which he was charged. The Regional Court likewise disregarded the presumption of innocence in stating that the grounds of appeal afforded no reason to suppose that the defendant would have been acquitted. It ought at most to have decided, after a summary examination of the case, that the appeal on points of law had some prospects of success, or it should have refrained from expressing a view. It was precisely for that reason that the applicant had requested an adjournment to await the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice in the appeal proceedings brought by one of the co-defendants. The court, however, had prejudged the Federal Court’s decision by holding that the plea alleging a breach of substantive law again provided nothing to support the hypothesis of an acquittal: the court should have known that vital points in Mr. [PERSON]’s appeal were also relied on by the co-defendant [PERSON] The applicant pointed out in addition that from the outset her husband had denied having committed any offences and had indeed been acquitted on several counts. In the light, inter alia, of Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) of the Convention, it therefore had to be assumed that in the event of a new trial he would have been acquitted completely. Since criminal law was based on the principle of individual guilt, it was quite simply unacceptable - and, once again, contrary to Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2) - to judge the deceased by the conduct of three of the co-defendants. In any case, the fact that those co-defendants had withdrawn their appeals on points of law could not be regarded as an admission of guilt; besides, they had held responsibilities within Stumm AG different from those of her husband.\n\nThe public prosecutor’s office in [LOCATION] and the principal public prosecutor’s office (Generalstaatsanwaltsschaft) at [LOCATION], to which Mrs. [PERSON]’s appeal (sofortige [PERSON]) had been forwarded for any comments, contended that the appeal should be dismissed. On [DATE_TIME], the [LOCATION] public prosecutor submitted that, having regard to the state of the proceedings, there was every likelihood (hohe [LOCATION]) that the conviction would have been upheld. The principal public prosecutor gave his opinion on [DATE_TIME]. He considered that an assessment of the likely outcome of the proceedings (Prüfung des mutmasslichen Verfahrensausgangs), having regard to the reasons given in the judgment of the Essen Regional Court and the grounds of the appeal on points of law, could lead to only one conclusion. It could be assumed - and, indeed, had to be - that if the proceedings had been continued, the defendant’s conviction would have been upheld. The principal public prosecutor took the view that the outcome of the appeal brought by the co-defendant M and still pending before the Federal Court of Justice was of some relevance in assessing the likely outcome of the proceedings concerning Mr. [PERSON], who, according to the aforementioned judgment, had committed his various offences in concert (Mittäterschaft) with the said co-defendant.\n\nThe applicant, to whom the public prosecutors’ observations had been communicated, replied on [DATE_TIME]. She stated, inter alia, that there were considerable dissimilarities between M and her husband as regards the charges against them, their behaviour and the grounds of their appeals; and as evidence of this she pointed to the indictment, the judgment convicting the defendants, and the appeals.\n\nThe Hamm Court of Appeal dismissed the action on [DATE_TIME]. It left open the question whether, in the event of a defendant’s death before the final conclusion (rechtskräftiger [PERSON]) of criminal proceedings, a decision such as that sought by Mrs. [PERSON] could be taken, by analogy, under Article 467 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 6(1)(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act (see paragraphs 24-26 below). And it added: “Even assuming such decisions are possible ([PERSON]), the assessment of the probable outcome of the trial, which must be made in both instances, leads to the conclusion that if the proceedings had been pursued until a final decision was handed down, the former defendant’s conviction would almost certainly (mit annähernder [LOCATION]) have been upheld. In order to avoid repetition, reference is made to the reasons given for the contested decision, which are valid (zutreffend). It should be noted in addition that the appeal on points of law of the co-defendant M was subsequently dismissed, on [DATE_TIME], by the Federal Court of Justice ... as being manifestly ill-founded. That fact is of particular importance in assessing the prospects of success which ... Mr. [PERSON]’s appeal would have had, because according to the reasons given for the judgment of [DATE_TIME], the offences of which [he] was convicted at first instance were committed together with ... [PERSON] ....“ On [DATE_TIME], the Court of Appeal rejected the objections (Gegenvorstellungen) which the applicant had lodged against the judgment of [DATE_TIME].\n\nMrs. [PERSON] then applied to the Federal Constitutional Court ([PERSON]), claiming a breach of Article 1 § 1 (protection of the dignity of man), Article 14 § 1 (the right of property) and Article 20 § 3 (principle of the rule of law) of the Basic Law. On [DATE_TIME], a bench of three judges of the Constitutional Court refused to entertain the constitutional complaint because it considered that the complaint did not have sufficient prospects of success. The reasons for its decision were as follows: “1. The presumption of innocence, which is founded on the principle of the rule of law, precludes treating as guilty a person who has not been finally (rechtskräftig) convicted. That does not mean, however, that in every case costs must be reimbursed where the proceedings are terminated without guilt having been established (Schuldnachweis) ...\n\nThe refusal of the applications for an order that the Treasury should bear the deceased defendant’s necessary costs and expenses is based on Article 467 § 3, second sentence, sub-paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The decision on the claim for compensation is based on section 6(1)(2) of the Criminal Proceedings (Compensation) Act. Both provisions, whose conformity with the Constitution cannot be doubted, confer on the courts a degree of discretion. There is nothing to suggest that the courts exercised their discretion in a manner contrary to the Constitution. (a) Admittedly, the decisions being challenged make a prediction of the probable outcome of the proceedings had they been continued. However, such an assessment does not amount to a finding of guilt but merely to a finding of a continuing state of suspicion ([PERSON] enthält indessen nicht die [LOCATION], sondern lediglich die [LOCATION] fortbestehenden Verdachtslage). Consequently, it does not offend the presumption of innocence. (b) Nor was the prediction of the outcome of the proceedings arbitrary in nature. (aa) Neither the alleged defects ... in the judgment convicting the defendant nor the grounds of the appeal on points of law make it possible to dismiss as untenable the conclusion reached in the contested decisions that a (subsequent) acquittal was unlikely in respect of each of the offences of which the deceased defendant had been convicted. That was the only relevant issue for the order as to costs. The courts’ reference to the lack of success of the appeal proceedings instituted by the co-defendant M and to the withdrawal of the appeals on points of law entered by the other defendants is clearly to be regarded merely as an additional argument, and the impugned decisions are not based on it. (bb) Nor do the grounds advanced in support of the constitutional complaint show the unreasonableness of the Regional Court’s opinion that, had the proceedings been continued, a conviction would have been more likely than an acquittal ... [in connection with the charge in respect of which the proceedings had been provisionally stayed] ... ....“",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 47297/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Kemal Bülbül (“the applicant”), on 22 December 1998.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr L. Kanat, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 4 March 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Ankara. At the time of the events, he was the provincial leader of HADEP (Halkın Demokrasi Partisi - People's Democracy Party) in Ankara.\n\nOn 18 November 1998 the military judge sitting on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court ordered the applicant's detention in absentia. According to the detention order, the applicant was suspected of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party).\n\nOn 19 November 1998 police officers conducted a search in the Ankara office of HADEP and the applicant was taken into police custody. In the search and arrest protocol, which was signed by the applicant, it was explained that the applicant was taken into custody pursuant to the detention order issued the day before by the Ankara State Security Court. Following his arrest, the applicant was brought before the military judge of the Ankara State Security Court and, on his order, was placed in detention on remand.\n\nOn 26 November 1998 the applicant filed an appeal against the detention order and requested his release.\n\nOn 27 November 1998, having regard to the nature of the offence and the state of the evidence, the Ankara State Security Court -composed of three judges including a military judge- dismissed the applicant's appeal.\n\nOn 8 December 1998 the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with aiding and abetting the PKK under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 12 July 1999 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn 24 February 2000 the Ankara State Security Court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting the PKK and sentenced him to three years and nine months' imprisonment.\n\nWhile the proceedings were pending before the Court of Cassation, on 21 December 2000 new legislation (Law No. 4616), which governed the conditional release, suspension of proceedings or execution of sentences in respect of offences committed before 23 April 1999, came into force. Accordingly, on 23 January 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nOn 2 May 2001 the Ankara State Security Court suspended the proceedings against the applicant. According to Law No. 4616, these proceedings would be resumed only if the applicant were to commit an offence of the same or more serious kind within five years of the court's decision to suspend the proceedings.\n\nIt appears from the documents in the file that no charges have been brought against the applicant during the period of suspension.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION]. At the time of the events, he was the provincial leader of HADEP (Halkın [PERSON] Democracy Party) in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the military judge sitting on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court ordered the applicant's detention in absentia. According to the detention order, the applicant was suspected of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] police officers conducted a search in the [LOCATION] office of HADEP and the applicant was taken into police custody. In the search and arrest protocol, which was signed by the applicant, it was explained that the applicant was taken into custody pursuant to the detention order issued [DATE_TIME] before by the Ankara State Security Court. Following his arrest, the applicant was brought before the military judge of the Ankara State Security Court and, on his order, was placed in detention on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed an appeal against the detention order and requested his release.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], having regard to the nature of the offence and the state of the evidence, the Ankara State Security Court -composed of three judges including a military judge- dismissed the applicant's appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with aiding and abetting the PKK under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ankara State Security Court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting the PKK and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment.\n\nWhile the proceedings were pending before the Court of Cassation, on [DATE_TIME] new legislation (Law No. 4616), which governed the conditional release, suspension of proceedings or execution of sentences in respect of offences committed before [DATE_TIME], came into force.

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44537/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Kazimierz Klimkiewicz (“the applicant”), on 14 October 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 25 September 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Government failed to submit their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Łόdź.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn 30 June 1997 the Łódź District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) instituted criminal proceedings against an individual charged with financial fraud. The applicant, who was considered to be a victim, was entitled to lodge in the context of the criminal case a claim for damages sustained as a result of the crime.\n\nOn 30 July 1997 the Łódź Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) filed a civil claim for damages against the defendant on the applicant’s behalf. On 29 August 1997 the District Court admitted the claim.\n\nA hearing scheduled for 25 January 2001 was adjourned because of the absence of the defendant, who had submitted a medical certificate indicating that he had health problems. On 13 February 2001 the defendant submitted another medical certificate stating that he had been admitted to a hospital. On 3 April 2001 the court held a hearing in the absence of the defendant. On 25 April 2001 the defendant submitted another medical certificate.\n\nOn 30 April 2001 the District Court ordered that the defendant be examined by a forensic specialist. On 23 July 2001 a medical report was submitted to the court. It stated that the defendant’s health prevented him from participating in the forthcoming hearings as he was to undergo surgery.\n\nOn 8 October 2001 the District Court stayed the proceedings and ordered the defendant to provide information on his medical treatment. The defendant failed to do so.\n\nOn 26 September 2002 the District Court issued an arrest warrant as the police had informed the court that the defendant had left his place of permanent residence. On 18 January 2003 the defendant was apprehended by the police and detained until 16 January 2004.\n\nOn 5 February 2003 the District Court again stayed the proceedings and ordered that the defendant be examined by a specialist. On 25 April 2003 a medical report was submitted to the court. It stated that the defendant’s health did not prevent him from participating in the proceedings.\n\nOn 25 September 2003 the court resumed the proceedings. On 28 October 2005 the court held a hearing.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 14 October 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Łódź Regional Court under section 5 of the Act of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn 3 December 2004 the Łódź Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court considered that the proceedings had lasted a long time but found no “unreasonable delays” considering that the conduct of the defendant had significantly contributed to the length of the proceedings. That period of delay could not be attributed to the judicial authorities as it had been caused by the fact that the defendant had repeatedly failed to comply with the court’s orders.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44537/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Government failed to submit their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [PERSON].\n\nA. Civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Łódź District Court ([PERSON]) instituted criminal proceedings against an individual charged with financial fraud. The applicant, who was considered to be a victim, was entitled to lodge in the context of the criminal case a claim for damages sustained as a result of the crime.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Łódź Regional Prosecutor ([PERSON]) filed a civil claim for damages against the defendant on the applicant’s behalf. On [DATE_TIME] the District Court admitted the claim.\n\nA hearing scheduled for [DATE_TIME] was adjourned because of the absence of the defendant, who had submitted a medical certificate indicating that he had health problems. On [DATE_TIME] the defendant submitted another medical certificate stating that he had been admitted to a hospital. On [DATE_TIME] the court held a hearing in the absence of the defendant. On [DATE_TIME] the defendant submitted another medical certificate.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court ordered that the defendant be examined by a forensic specialist. On [DATE_TIME] a medical report was submitted to the court. It stated that the defendant’s health prevented him from participating in the forthcoming hearings as he was to undergo surgery.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court stayed the proceedings and ordered the defendant to provide information on his medical treatment. The defendant failed to do so.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court issued an arrest warrant as the police had informed the court that the defendant had left his place of permanent residence. On [DATE_TIME] the defendant was apprehended by the police and detained until [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court again stayed the proceedings and ordered that the defendant be examined by a specialist. On [DATE_TIME] a medical report was submitted to the court. It stated that the defendant’s health did not prevent him from participating in the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court resumed the proceedings. On [DATE_TIME] the court held a hearing.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint with the Łódź Regional Court under section 5 of the Act of [DATE_TIME] on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Łódź Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court considered that the proceedings had lasted a long time but found no “unreasonable delays” considering that the conduct of the defendant had significantly contributed to the length of the proceedings. That period of delay could not be attributed to the judicial authorities as it had been caused by the fact that the defendant had repeatedly failed to comply with the court’s orders.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41956/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Yavuz Aksaç (“the applicant”), on 6 January 1998.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr H. Erdoğan and Mr L. Kanat, lawyers practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that he had been denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He further complained under Article 6 § 3 (b) that the written opinion of the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments. He finally contended that he had been convicted merely on account of his association with a left-wing magazine, in violation of his rights under Articles 9 and 10.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 15 January 2004 the Court declared the application partly admissible. It retained the applicant’s complaints concerning his right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal and his right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn 24 May 2004 the case was assigned to the Third Section of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Ankara.\n\nOn 23 March 1995 the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody by police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate. He was accused of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front).\n\nOn 6 April 1995 the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court filed an indictment with the latter charging the applicant, under Articles 168 § 2 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, with membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 10 April 1996 the Ankara State Security Court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C, and sentenced him to three years and nine months’ imprisonment and debarred him from public service for three years.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 11 June 1997 the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebliğname) on the merits of the appeal to the Court of Cassation. The chief public prosecutor proposed that the first instance court’s judgment be upheld. The written opinion of the chief public prosecutor was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn 10 July 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal upholding the Ankara State Security Court’s judgment.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicant alleged under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that he had been denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He further complained under Article 6 § 3 (b) that the written opinion of the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments. He finally contended that he had been convicted merely on account of his association with a left-wing magazine, in violation of his rights under Articles 9 and 10.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly admissible. It retained the applicant’s complaints concerning his right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal and his right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the case was assigned to [LOCATION].\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody by police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate. He was accused of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court filed an indictment with the latter charging the applicant, under Articles 168 § 2 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, with membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ankara State Security Court found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C, and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment and debarred him from public service for [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant appealed. On [DATE_TIME] the chief public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion (tebliğname) on the merits of the appeal to the Court of Cassation. The chief public prosecutor proposed that the first instance court’s judgment be upheld. The written opinion of the chief public prosecutor was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal upholding the Ankara State Security Court’s judgment.",

Kaplan, a lawyer practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nRelying on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention the applicant complained that his detention in police custody lasted seven days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power. He also complained under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention that Turkish Law does not afford any effective remedy by which the lawfulness of his detention in police custody could be decided speedily.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr F. Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nOn 30 May 2000 the Chamber retained the applicant's complaints under Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 5 June 1995 police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the İstanbul Security Directorate arrested the applicant, who was a student at the time, on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK.\n\nOn 6 June 1995 the head of the anti-terrorist branch of the İstanbul Security Directorate wrote a letter to the Chief Public Prosecutor at the İstanbul State Security Court requesting permission for an extension of the applicant's detention in police custody until 12 June 1995. On the same day the Public Prosecutor no. 23783 granted the extension requested.\n\nOn 12 June 1995 the Public Prosecutor no. 16429 at the İstanbul State Security Court questioned the applicant in relation to his actions within the PKK and submitted a petition to the İstanbul State Security Court requesting an order for the applicant's detention on remand.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was brought before the İstanbul State Security Court which ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 23 August 1995 the Chief Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the İstanbul State Security Court charging the applicant with membership of the PKK. The charges were brought under Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713 as well as Article 19 § 2 of Law no. 2918 (Traffic Act).\n\nOn 9 August 1996 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn 18 November 1998 the applicant was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in accordance with Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29296/95) against [LOCATION] lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented before the Court by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nRelying on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention the applicant complained that his detention in police custody lasted [DATE_TIME] without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power. He also complained under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention that Turkish Law does not afford any effective remedy by which the lawfulness of his detention in police custody could be decided speedily.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr [PERSON], the judge elected in respect of [LOCATION], withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed [PERSON] to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chamber retained the applicant's complaints under Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the İstanbul Security Directorate arrested the applicant, who was a student at the time, on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the PKK.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the head of the anti-terrorist branch of the İstanbul Security Directorate wrote a letter to the Chief Public Prosecutor at the İstanbul State Security Court requesting permission for an extension of the applicant's detention in police custody until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the Public Prosecutor no. 23783 granted the extension requested.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Public Prosecutor no. [PHONE_NUMBER] at the İstanbul State Security Court questioned the applicant in relation to his actions within the PKK and submitted a petition to the İstanbul State Security Court requesting an order for the applicant's detention on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the applicant was brought before the İstanbul State Security Court which ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chief Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the İstanbul State Security Court charging the applicant with membership of the PKK. The charges were brought under Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713 as well as Article 19 § 2 of Law no. 2918 (Traffic Act).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was sentenced to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment in accordance with Article 168 § 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code.",

İşeri, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.\n\nOn 16 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Gaziantep.\n\nOn 14 January 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody by police officers from the Anti-Terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party).\n\nOn 23 January 1995 he was brought before a single judge of the Izmir State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 13 February 1995 the principal public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with the latter charging the applicant under Article 125 of the Criminal Code with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory.\n\nOn 2 December 1998 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to death under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Taking into account the applicant's behaviour during the trial, the death penalty was commuted to a life sentence.\n\nOn 17 April 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn 26 April 2000 the Court of Cassation's decision was pronounced in the absence of the applicant's representative.\n\nOn 1 June 2000 the Court of Cassation's decision was deposited with the registry of the First Instance Court.\n\nOn 21 December 2000 Law no. 4616, which governed the conditional release, suspension of proceedings or execution of sentences in respect of offences committed before 23 April 1999, came into force. The law stipulated that parole would not be applicable to persons who had committed offences under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Thus, the applicant could not benefit from Law no. 4616.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was taken into police custody by police officers from the Anti-Terror branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] he was brought before a single judge of the Izmir State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the principal public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with the latter charging the applicant under Article 125 of the Criminal Code with carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to death under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Taking into account the applicant's behaviour during the trial, the death penalty was commuted to a life sentence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Izmir State Security Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation's decision was pronounced in the absence of the applicant's representative.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation's decision was deposited with the registry of the First Instance Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Law no. 4616, which governed the conditional release, suspension of proceedings or execution of sentences in respect of offences committed before [DATE_TIME], came into force. The law stipulated that parole would not be applicable to persons who had committed offences under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. Thus, the applicant could not benefit from Law no. 4616.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Danish nationals, Mr Morten Sørensen (“the first applicant”) and Mr Ove Rasmussen (“the second applicant”), on 7 October 1999 and 22 September 1999 respectively.\n\nThe first applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr J. Paulsen, a lawyer practising in Herning. The second applicant was represented by Mr J.P. Buhl, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Taksøe-Jensen, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicants complained that the existence of closed-shop agreements in Denmark in their respective areas of employment had violated their right to freedom of association, secured by Article 11 of the Convention.\n\nThe applications were allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). By decisions of 20 March 2003, the applications were declared partly admissible. The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In a decision of 25 November 2004, a Chamber constituted within the First Section, composed of Christos Rozakis, President, Peer Lorenzen, Giovanni Bonello, Françoise Tulkens, Nina Vajić, Vladimiro Zagrebelsky and Elisabeth Steiner, judges, and Søren Nielsen, Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).\n\nThe composition of the Grand Chamber was fixed in accordance with Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. The President of the Grand Chamber decided to join the applications (Rule 42 § 1). Elisabeth Steiner, who was unable to take part in the deliberations following the hearing, was replaced by Loukis Loucaides, first substitute judge.\n\nThe Government, but not the applicants, filed supplementary observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nThird-party comments were received from the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (Landsorganisationen – LO), which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2). The applicants replied to those comments (Rule 44 § 5).\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 22 June 2005 (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr P. Taksøe-Jensen, Agent, Ms N. Holst-Christensen, Co-Agent, Mr E. Oest Edelsberg, Ms D. Borgaard, Mr D. Kendal, Ms K. Weber Olsen, Mr J. Rasmussen, Advisers; (b) for the applicants Mr E. Lego Andersen, Mr J. Paulsen, Mr S. Juul, Counsel, Mr J. Mikkelsen, Mr S. Fibiger Olesen, Mr E. Bertelsen, Mr A. Bagge Jørgensen, Advisers. The Court heard addresses by Mr Lego Andersen and Mr Taksøe-Jensen, as well as their replies to questions from judges.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The first applicant\n\nThe first applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Århus, Denmark. In the spring of 1996 he did his national service. Since a few months remained before he could commence studying mathematics and physics at the University of Århus, on 10 May 1996 he applied for a job as a holiday relief worker in a company, FDB Distributionen (“FDB”). For this purpose, he filled in an application form, which contained a pre-printed paragraph stating, among other things: “To obtain the job it is mandatory to be a member of one of the trade unions affiliated to the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO). You will be informed on request of the name of the union.”\n\nIn a letter of 20 May 1996, the applicant was offered the job from 3 June until 10 August 1996 and informed that his terms of employment would be regulated by an agreement concluded between FDB and a trade union called SID, which was affiliated to LO, and of which the applicant was obliged to become a member.\n\nFrom his first payslip on 20 June 1996 the applicant became aware that he was paying a subscription to SID, although he had not applied for membership. Instead, at the time of his appointment he had applied for membership of a trade union called Denmark's Free Trade Union (Danmarks Frie Fagforening). In a letter of 23 June 1996, the applicant informed his employer and the shop steward that he did not want to pay the subscription to SID because he had been told that, as a holiday relief employee, he would not be given full membership of SID.\n\nConsequently, on 24 June 1996, the applicant was dismissed for not satisfying the requirements for obtaining the job as he was not a member of a trade union affiliated to LO.\n\nThe applicant, represented by Denmark's Free Trade Union, instituted proceedings before the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) against FDB, requesting that FDB be ordered to acknowledge that his dismissal was unlawful and to pay him compensation. He alleged that section 2(2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act of 9 June 1982 (Lov om beskyttelse mod afskedigelse på grund af foreningsforhold), as amended on 13 June 1990, violated Article 11 of the Convention as it allowed an employer to require an employee to be a member of a specific association in order to obtain employment. The applicant stated, among other things, that he did not share SID's political views.\n\nOn 18 November 1998 the High Court found for FDB, stating as follows: “The High Court finds it established that the applicant was aware that membership of SID was a condition for his employment in the company. Thus, since the applicant did not comply with this requirement the conditions for dismissing him are fulfilled in accordance with section 2, subsection (2), in conjunction with subsection (1), of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act. Therefore, the pertinent question is whether the Act in issue, and with it the applicant's dismissal, is at variance with Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in the light of the interpretation this Article has been given by the European Court of Human Rights in its recent case-law. The Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act was passed by Parliament in 1982 as a result, inter alia, of the British Rail judgment (Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, Series A no. 44) delivered by the European Court of Human Rights in 1981. In this judgment it was established that in certain circumstances Article 11 also secured the negative right to freedom of association. In the assessment of whether, subsequent to the Court's recent case-law, the domestic courts should disregard section 2(2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act, the starting-point must be taken from the Act of 1992 incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. According to the preparatory notes, incorporation of the Convention was not intended to change the existing balance between the Danish parliament and the Danish courts. Thus, in the view of the High Court, while taking into account the rights and obligations that may be inferred from the European Convention on Human Rights, Parliament still has considerable discretion when laying down Danish law. In this connection, it is also of importance to note that a decision abolishing or limiting the existing possibility of entering into closed-shop agreements will have far-reaching consequences for the Danish labour market. In support of the applicant's understanding of the scope of Article 11, reference has been made to the Sigurður A. Sigurjόnsson v. Iceland judgment of 1993 and the Gustafsson v. Sweden judgment of 1996. However, in the view of the High Court, an interpretation of these judgments does not establish with the necessary certainty that section 2(2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act is at variance with Article 11 of the Convention.”\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court (Højesteret) upheld the High Court's judgment on 8 June 1999. In its reasoning the Supreme Court stated as follows: “The Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act (Law no. 285 of 9 June 1982) was passed notably in order to comply with the negative right to freedom of association to the extent that such an obligation could be established according to the interpretation of Article 11 of the Convention given by the European Court of Human Rights in the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment, Series A no. 44 (British Rail). As stated in the Supreme Court's judgment of 6 May 1999 [see paragraph 21 below], the latest judgments of the European Court of Human Rights provide no grounds for a different assessment of the lawfulness of closed-shop agreements and their consequences from that appearing in the British Rail judgment. In addition, section 2(2), of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act of 9 June 1982 raises no doubts as to its compatibility with this judgment.”\n\nB. The second applicant\n\nThe second applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Haderslev, Denmark. He is a gardener by profession. He became a member of SID in the mid-1980s, but resigned his membership after a few years as he felt unable to support its political affiliations. Instead, he became a member of the Christian Trade Union (Kristelig Fagforening).\n\nHaving been unemployed for a while, he was offered a job at a nursery (Gartneriet i Regnmark I/S) on condition that he became a member of SID as the employer had entered into a closed-shop agreement with that trade union. The applicant commenced the job on 17 May 1999 and rejoined SID, although he still did not agree with its political views.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. [DATE_TIME] and 52620/99) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two [NRP] nationals, Mr [PERSON] (“the first applicant”) and Mr [PERSON] (“the second applicant”), on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] respectively.\n\nThe first applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in Herning. The second applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON], of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicants complained that the existence of closed-shop agreements in [LOCATION] in their respective areas of employment had violated their right to freedom of association, secured by Article 11 of the Convention.\n\nThe applications were allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). By decisions of [DATE_TIME], the applications were declared partly admissible. The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). In a decision of [DATE_TIME], a [LOCATION] constituted within the First Section, composed of [PERSON], President, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON], judges, and [PERSON], Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, none of the parties having objected (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72).\n\nThe composition of the Grand Chamber was fixed in accordance with Article 27 §§ 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. The President of the Grand Chamber decided to join the applications (Rule 42 § 1). [PERSON], who was unable to take part in the deliberations following the hearing, was replaced by [PERSON], first substitute judge.\n\nThe Government, but not the applicants, filed supplementary observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nThird-party comments were received from the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions ([PERSON] – LO), which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 2). The applicants replied to those comments (Rule 44 § 5).\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, [LOCATION], on [DATE_TIME] (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr [PERSON], Agent, [PERSON], Co-Agent, Mr [PERSON], [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Advisers; (b) for the applicants Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr S. Juul, Counsel, Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Advisers. The Court heard addresses by Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON], as well as their replies to questions from judges.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The first applicant\n\nThe first applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION]. In [DATE_TIME] he did his national service. Since [DATE_TIME] remained before he could commence studying mathematics and physics at the University of Århus, on [DATE_TIME] he applied for a job as a holiday relief worker in a company, FDB Distributionen (“FDB”). For this purpose, he filled in an application form, which contained a pre-printed paragraph stating, among other things: “To obtain the job it is mandatory to be a member of one of the trade unions affiliated to the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO). You will be informed on request of the name of the union.”\n\nIn a letter of [DATE_TIME], the applicant was offered the job from [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME] and informed that his terms of employment would be regulated by an agreement concluded between FDB and a trade union called SID, which was affiliated to LO, and of which the applicant was obliged to become a member.\n\nFrom his first payslip on [DATE_TIME] the applicant became aware that he was paying a subscription to SID, although he had not applied for membership. Instead, at the time of his appointment he had applied for membership of a trade union called [LOCATION]'s Free Trade Union ([PERSON]). In a letter of [DATE_TIME], the applicant informed his employer and the shop steward that he did not want to pay the subscription to SID because he had been told that, as a holiday relief employee, he would not be given full membership of SID.\n\nConsequently, on [DATE_TIME], the applicant was dismissed for not satisfying the requirements for obtaining the job as he was not a member of a trade union affiliated to LO.\n\nThe applicant, represented by [LOCATION]'s Free Trade Union, instituted proceedings before the High Court of Western Denmark ([PERSON]) against FDB, requesting that FDB be ordered to acknowledge that his dismissal was unlawful and to pay him compensation. He alleged that section 2(2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act of [DATE_TIME] (Lov om beskyttelse mod [PERSON]), as amended on [DATE_TIME], violated Article 11 of the Convention as it allowed an employer to require an employee to be a member of a specific association in order to obtain employment. The applicant stated, among other things, that he did not share SID's political views.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the High Court found for FDB, stating as follows: “The High Court finds it established that the applicant was aware that membership of SID was a condition for his employment in the company. Thus, since the applicant did not comply with this requirement the conditions for dismissing him are fulfilled in accordance with section 2, subsection (2), in conjunction with subsection (1), of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act. Therefore, the pertinent question is whether the Act in issue, and with it the applicant's dismissal, is at variance with Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in the light of the interpretation this Article has been given by the European Court of Human Rights in its recent case-law. The Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act was passed by Parliament in [DATE_TIME] as a result, inter alia, of the British Rail judgment ([PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON] v. [LOCATION], Series A no. 44) delivered by the European Court of Human Rights in [DATE_TIME]. In this judgment it was established that in certain circumstances Article 11 also secured the negative right to freedom of association. In the assessment of whether, subsequent to the Court's recent case-law, the domestic courts should disregard section 2(2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act, the starting-point must be taken from the Act of [DATE_TIME] incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. According to the preparatory notes, incorporation of the Convention was not intended to change the existing balance between the [NRP] parliament and the [NRP] courts. Thus, in the view of the High Court, while taking into account the rights and obligations that may be inferred from the European Convention on Human Rights, Parliament still has considerable discretion when laying down [NRP] law. In this connection, it is also of importance to note that a decision abolishing or limiting the existing possibility of entering into closed-shop agreements will have far-reaching consequences for the [NRP] labour market. In support of the applicant's understanding of the scope of Article 11, reference has been made to the Sigurður A. Sigurjόnsson v. [LOCATION] judgment of [DATE_TIME] and the [PERSON] v. [LOCATION] judgment of [DATE_TIME]. However, in the view of the High Court, an interpretation of these judgments does not establish with the necessary certainty that section 2(2) of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act is at variance with Article 11 of the Convention.”\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court (Højesteret) upheld the High Court's judgment on [DATE_TIME]. In its reasoning the Supreme Court stated as follows: “The Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act (Law no. 285 of [DATE_TIME]) was passed notably in order to comply with the negative right to freedom of association to the extent that such an obligation could be established according to the interpretation of Article 11 of the Convention given by the European Court of Human Rights in the Young, [PERSON] and [PERSON] v. the [LOCATION] judgment, Series A no. 44 (British Rail). As stated in the Supreme Court's judgment of [DATE_TIME] [see paragraph 21 below], the latest judgments of the European Court of Human Rights provide no grounds for a different assessment of the lawfulness of closed-shop agreements and their consequences from that appearing in the British Rail judgment. In addition, section 2(2), of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act of [DATE_TIME] raises no doubts as to its compatibility with this judgment.”\n\nB. The second applicant\n\nThe second applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. He is a gardener by profession. He became a member of SID in [DATE_TIME], but resigned his membership after [DATE_TIME] as he felt unable to support its political affiliations. Instead, he became a member of the Christian Trade Union ([PERSON]).\n\nHaving been unemployed for a while, he was offered a job at a nursery ([PERSON] i Regnmark I/S) on condition that he became a member of SID as the employer had entered into a closed-shop agreement with that trade union. The applicant commenced the job on [DATE_TIME] and rejoined SID, although he still did not agree with its political views.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 13007/02 and 13924/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr İbrahim Şahin and Mr Erdoğan Sürgeç (“the applicants”) on 26 February 2002.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr H. Aygün and Mr Ö.U. Kaplan, lawyers practising in Tunceli. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 4 September 2003 the Court joined the applications. It further declared the applications partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the applicants’ detention in police custody to the Government.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nIn a letter of 24 June 2005, the Court informed the parties that in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1979 and 1973 respectively and were detained in Malatya prison at the time of the lodging of their applications with the Court.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the applicants were arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of their involvement in the activities of the PKK (The Kurdistan Workers’ Party). On 9 November 2001 the Tunceli Magistrates’ Court ordered their remand in custody.\n\nThe public prosecutor at the Malatya State Security Court in his indictment, dated 7 December 2001, accused the first applicant of membership of the PKK and the second applicant of aiding and abetting that organisation. The charges were brought under Articles 168 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713.\n\nOn 10 September 2002 the Malatya State Security Court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced the first applicant to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment and the second applicant to three years and nine months’ imprisonment and a fine of 177,957,000 Turkish liras.\n\nThe parties did not submit any documents pertaining to the outcome of the criminal proceedings. However, in their submissions on just satisfaction, dated 21 July 2005, the applicants stated that the Malatya State Security Court, pursuant to Law no. 4959 of 29 July 2003 on rehabilitation (topluma kazandırma), had decided not to sentence the applicants (ceza tertibi) and suspended the proceedings. They further submitted that this decision was upheld by the Court of Cassation.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 52468/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Tadeusz Sienkiewicz (“the applicant”), on 30 March 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the proceedings in his case had not been conducted within a reasonable time.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 10 September 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Szczecin, Poland.\n\nIn 1989 the applicant, who worked as head of a department in a state-owned enterprise dealing with conservation of old buildings, was dismissed. Subsequently, he filed with the Szczecin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an action in which he requested that his dismissal be declared null and void, as well as that he be reinstated in his former post.\n\nOn 16 February 1990 the court dismissed his action. The applicant appealed, but on 22 June 1990 the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed his appeal.\n\nOn 7 June 1993 the Ombudsman lodged an extraordinary appeal against the Regional Court’s judgment.\n\nOn 14 July 1993 the Supreme Court quashed that judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.\n\nIn his pleadings of 28 March 1994 the applicant withdrew his claim for reinstatement in his former post and raised a compensation claim.\n\nThe District Court held hearings on 9 May and 28 November 1994, as well as on 2 and 25 January 1995.\n\nOn 25 January 1995 it dismissed the action again.\n\nOn 30 June 1995 the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the District Court’s judgment.\n\nOn 2 August 1996 the Ombudsman lodged a cassation appeal against that judgment.\n\nOn 13 December 1996 the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.\n\nOn 23 April 1997 the Szczecin District Court stayed the proceedings, because of the fact that insolvency proceedings concerning the defendant were pending. The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. On 30 June 1997 it was dismissed by the Szczecin Regional Court.\n\nOn 21 September 1998 the District Court resumed the proceedings.\n\nOn 22 October 1998 it held a hearing.\n\nOn 26 October 1998 the court awarded the applicant a partial compensation. The applicant appealed against that judgment.\n\nOn 17 February 1999 the Szczecin Regional Court held a hearing.\n\nOn 24 February 1999 it quashed the judgment of 26 October 1998 and remitted the case for re-examination.\n\nThe District Court held hearings on 23 July, as well as on 15 and 29 November 1999.\n\nOn 29 November 1999 it gave a judgment, in which it awarded the applicant compensation. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe Szczecin Regional Court held hearings on 10 and 31 May 2000.\n\nOn 31 May 2000 it amended the judgment under appeal in that it increased the amount of the compensation.",

Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the applicant, who worked as head of a department in a state-owned enterprise dealing with conservation of old buildings, was dismissed. Subsequently, he filed with the Szczecin District Court ([PERSON]) an action in which he requested that his dismissal be declared null and void, as well as that he be reinstated in his former post.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court dismissed his action. The applicant appealed, but on [DATE_TIME] the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed his appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ombudsman lodged an extraordinary appeal against the Regional Court’s judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court quashed that judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.\n\nIn his pleadings of [DATE_TIME] the applicant withdrew his claim for reinstatement in his former post and raised a compensation claim.\n\nThe District Court held hearings on [DATE_TIME], as well as on 2 and 25 [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] it dismissed the action again.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the District Court’s judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ombudsman lodged a cassation appeal against that judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and remitted the case for re-examination.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Szczecin District Court stayed the proceedings, because of the fact that insolvency proceedings concerning the defendant were pending. The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. On [DATE_TIME] it was dismissed by the Szczecin Regional Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court resumed the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] it held a hearing.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court awarded the applicant a partial compensation.

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 9907/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Emine Araç (“the applicant”), on 22 October 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Muller and Mr T. Otty, lawyers practising in London, and by Mr H. Tuna in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 19 September 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to give notice to the Government of the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In accordance with Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it also decided to examine the admissibility and merits of the case at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 24 September 1998 the applicant, a student in the Faculty of Theology of İnönü University in Malatya, sought to enrol in the Faculty of Theology of Marmara University. For that purpose she provided, among other materials, an identity photograph which showed her wearing a headscarf.\n\nOn 1 October 1998 the Faculty of Theology of Marmara University replied to the applicant, informing her that the identity photograph she had supplied did not comply with the regulations in force and that where this was the case, the person concerned could not be enrolled.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with the Istanbul Administrative Court. She requested, in particular, that the refusal of the administrative authorities be set aside as being in breach of her rights.\n\nIn a judgment of 23 September 1999, the Administrative Court rejected the application, finding that the authorities’ refusal had been in accordance with the regulations in force. The court considered, in particular, that the applicant had submitted an identity photograph which did not conform to the regulations, which stipulated that “photographs must show the subject facing forward and be less than six months old, so that the person concerned is readily identifiable; the head and neck must also be uncovered” (Article 4 § 1 (f) of the Guide for University Applicants adopted by the Higher Education Board on 17 April 1998).\n\nFollowing an appeal by the applicant on points of law, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of 23 September 1999, finding it to have been in accordance with the law and the procedural rules. The relevant parts of the Supreme Administrative Court judgment read as follows: “Summary of the request: ... Opinion of Mrs Serpil K. Erdoğan, investigating judge of the Supreme Administrative Court: the judge is of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the first-instance judgment upheld. Opinion of Mr H. Hüseyin Tok, State Counsel (savcı) at the Supreme Administrative Court: the grounds of appeal set out in the statement of grounds do not correspond to those enumerated in Article 49 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure. In view of the juridical and legal arguments on which the first-instance judgment was based, these grounds cannot be said to require the quashing of the impugned judgment ...”",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 15649/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Bahar Yeşilyurt (“the applicant”), on 27 April 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M.S. Talay, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 10 September 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Batman.\n\nOn 12 October 1995 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. On 25 October 1995 she was brought before the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered her detention on remand.\n\nOn 29 November 1995 the Istanbul State Security Court Public Prosecutor declared a lack of jurisdiction and transferred the case file to the Diyarbakır State Security Court.\n\nOn 29 December 1995 the Public Prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed an indictment with that court accusing her, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities that undermined the constitutional order of the State. The prosecution requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe trial commenced before the Diyarbakır State Security Court. In the subsequent hearings, the court refused to release the applicant on account of the nature of the alleged offence and the state of evidence.\n\nOn 12 June 2001 the applicant submitted a petition to the Diyarbakır State Security Court, alleging that she had been ill-treated during police custody.\n\nThe case against the applicant continued before the Diyarbakır State Security Court until 7 May 2004 when, following a constitutional amendment, State Security Courts were abolished. Thereafter, the applicant's case was transferred to the Diyarbakır Assize Court.\n\nOn 3 November 2004 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nOn 26 January 2005 the Diyarbakır Assize Court declared its lack of jurisdiction and transferred the applicant's case to the Diyarbakır Juvenile Court, holding that the applicant had been a minor at the time of the events.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the Diyarbakır Juvenile Court also declared its non-jurisdiction and the case file was then transferred to the Batman Assize Court.\n\n9 May 2005 the Batman Assize Court declared a lack of jurisdiction and transmitted the case file to the Court of Cassation to resolve the jurisdictional conflict.\n\nOn 17 October 2006 the Court of Cassation decided that the case should be heard by the Batman Assize Court.\n\nOn 4 December 2007 the Batman Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the charges against her.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant applied to the Midyat Assize Court seeking compensation for both non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage pursuant to Law no. 466 pertaining to the payment of compensation to persons unjustifiably arrested or detained. On 24 April 2008 the Midyat Assize Court awarded the applicant 11,881 Turkish liras (TRY) in respect of pecuniary damage and TRY 10,0000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. According to the information submitted by the applicant, the proceedings are still pending before the Court of Cassation, following her appeal, and she has not yet received the due amount.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 40909/08) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Krzysztof Kulik (“the applicant”), on 6 August 2008.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 2 April 2009 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nOn 16 June 2009 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Nowogród Bobrzański.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn 4 February 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant.\n\nOn 2 January 2007 the applicant was indicted before the Jelenia Góra Regional Court. He was charged with several counts of robbery. The bill of indictment comprised 14 accused.\n\nOn 9 March 2007 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court found that it had no competence to deal with the case and referred it to the Zielona Góra Regional Court.\n\nOn 22 June 2007 the case was remitted to the Zielona Góra Regional Prosecutor in connection with another investigation conducted against one of the applicant’s co-accused.\n\nThe first hearing was set down for 23 January 2008; however, on 22 January 2008, it was adjourned as the applicant’s co-accused’s counsel had not been properly summoned.\n\nThe hearing, scheduled for 28 February 2008 was adjourned as a motion for the judge to step down was to be considered.\n\nA subsequent hearing, listed for 15 April 2008, was cancelled because it was not possible for the police to bring the applicant’s co-accused from prison.\n\nThe hearing, scheduled for 20 May 2008, was adjourned as priority had been given to another case.\n\nThe hearing, scheduled for 21 May 2008, was adjourned as another motion for the judge to step down was to be considered.\n\nAs of August 2009 the proceedings were still pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 16 June 2008 the applicant filed with the Poznań Court of Appeal a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time in respect of the criminal proceedings instituted against him and asked for just satisfaction. He relied on the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), which entered into force on 17 September 2004.\n\nThe applicant stressed that he had been detained while awaiting his trial and sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Zielona Góra Regional Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (the equivalent of approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn 19 June 2008 the Poznań Court of Appeal gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings before the Zielona Góra Regional Court, finding that there had been a period of unjustified inactivity from 26 March 2007 until 5 December 2007. However, the court did not grant any just satisfaction to the applicant, pointing out that the decision whether to grant compensation in such proceedings was facultative.",

Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed with the Poznań Court of Appeal a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time in respect of the criminal proceedings instituted against him and asked for just satisfaction. He relied on the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), which entered into force on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant stressed that he had been detained while awaiting his trial and sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Zielona Góra Regional Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (the equivalent of approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings before the Zielona Góra Regional Court, finding that there had been a period of unjustified inactivity from [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME]. However, the court did not grant any just satisfaction to the applicant, pointing out that the decision whether to grant compensation in such proceedings was facultative.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29865/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mrs Ayten Ünal Tekeli (“the applicant”), on 20 December 1995.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mrs Aydan Demirel Ersezen, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the refusal by the domestic courts to allow her to bear only her maiden name unjustifiably interfered with her right to protection of her private life. She further alleged that she had been discriminated against in that only married men could continue to bear their own family name after they married. In that connection she relied on Article 8 of the Convention, read alone and in conjunction with Article 14.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 1 July 2003 the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 13 January 2004 (Rule 59 § 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mrs Deniz akcay, co-Agent, Mrs Burçe Arı, Mrs Işık Batmaz Keremoğlu, Mrs Banur özaydın, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Mrs Aydan Demirel Ersezen, Counsel, Mr Hayati Torun, Interpreter. The applicant also attended the hearing.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Ayten Ünal Tekeli, is a Turkish national, born in 1965 and living in İzmir.\n\nAfter her marriage on 25 December 1990 the applicant, who was then a trainee lawyer, took her husband’s name pursuant to Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code. As she was known by her maiden name in her professional life, she continued putting it in front of her legal surname. However, she could not use both names together on official documents.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the applicant brought proceedings in the Karşıyaka Court of First Instance (“the Court of First Instance”) for permission to use only her maiden name, “Ünal”. On 4 April 1995 the Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s request on the ground that, under Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code, married women had to bear their husband’s name throughout their married life.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant on points of law was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 6 June 1995. The decision was served on the applicant on 23 June 1995.\n\nBy one of the amendments made to Article 153 of the Civil Code on 14 May 1997, married women acquired the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband’s surname. The applicant preferred not to make use of that possibility because, in her view, the amendment in question did not satisfy her demand, which was to use her maiden name alone as her surname. On 22 November 2001 the new Civil Code was enacted. Article 187 was worded identically to the former Article 153.",

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, [PERSON], is a [NRP] national, born in [DATE_TIME] and living in [LOCATION].\n\nAfter her marriage on [DATE_TIME] the applicant, who was then a trainee lawyer, took her husband’s name pursuant to Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code. As she was known by her maiden name in her professional life, she continued putting it in front of her legal surname. However, she could not use both names together on official documents.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant brought proceedings in the Karşıyaka Court of First Instance (“the Court of First Instance”) for permission to use only her maiden name, “Ünal”. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s request on the ground that, under Article 153 of the Turkish Civil Code, married women had to bear their husband’s name throughout their married life.\n\nAn appeal by the applicant on points of law was dismissed by the Court of Cassation on [DATE_TIME]. The decision was served on the applicant on [DATE_TIME].\n\nBy one of the amendments made to Article 153 of the Civil Code on [DATE_TIME], married women acquired the right to put their maiden name in front of their husband’s surname. The applicant preferred not to make use of that possibility because, in her view, the amendment in question did not satisfy her demand, which was to use her maiden name alone as her surname. On [DATE_TIME] the new Civil Code was enacted. Article 187 was worded identically to the former Article 153.",

Drzewicki and, subsequently, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 21 January 2003 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Wiśniowa, Poland.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1989 the applicant’s father lodged an application with the Myślenice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) for distribution of the inheritance from his late wife. The applicant was a participant in the proceedings.\n\nBetween October 1989 and December 1992 the court held four hearings.\n\nOn 19 February 1993 the court ordered that expert evidence be obtained.\n\nOn 26 May 1993 four of the participants challenged the expert opinion.\n\nOn 2 November 1994 the applicant submitted her own proposal to the court for distribution of inheritance.\n\nOn 15 November 1994 the expert submitted his new opinion.\n\nAt a hearing on 19 January 1995 the court proposed that the participants conclude a friendly settlement. Only two of the participants accepted the court’s proposal.\n\nAt a hearing on 23 March 1995 the court ordered that new expert evidence be obtained. It also ordered the participants to pay an advance to cover the costs of the preparation of an expert report..\n\nOn 17 September 1997 the court decided that, as the participants had failed to comply with the order of 23 March 1995, the costs of the preparation of expert opinions would be temporarily covered by the court.\n\nBetween 17 January 1996 and 16 July 1998, J.M., one of the participants in the proceedings, unsuccessfully challenged the presiding judge four times.\n\nOn 2 October 1998 and 4 March 1999 the court appointed experts to prepare opinions on agriculture and forestry. The experts submitted their reports on 12 November 1998 and 21 March 1999 respectively.\n\nOn November 1999 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 30 November 1999 the Myślenice District Court gave judgment.\n\nOn 27 March 2000 the Kraków Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the applicant’s appeal.\n\nOn 28 June 2001 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) refused to deal with her cassation appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 3976/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Şerife Yiğit (“the applicant”), on 6 December 2004.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr H. Akbaht, a lawyer practising in Antakya. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 15 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. By virtue of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention it was also decided to examine the admissibility and the merits of the case at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Gaziantep.\n\nThe applicant was the partner of Ömer Koç (Ö.K.), with whom she entered into a religious marriage (imam nikah) in 1976 and had six children. Ö.K. died on 10 September 2002.\n\nA. Action before the İslahiye District Court\n\nOn 11 September 2003 the applicant brought an action before the İslahiye District Court, in her own name and that of her daughter Emine, seeking to have her marriage to Ö.K. recognised and to have Emine entered in the civil register as the deceased’s daughter.\n\nIn a judgment of 26 September 2003 the İslahiye District Court dismissed the applicant’s action regarding the marriage but granted the request for Emine to be entered in the register as Ö.K.’s daughter. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final.\n\nB. Application to the Hatay Labour Court\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant requested the Hatay retirement pension fund (Bağ Kur) to grant her and her daughter Emine the benefit of her deceased partner’s retirement pension and health insurance rights. On an unspecified date the fund refused the request. On 20 February 2003 the applicant applied to the İslahiye Labour Court to have that decision set aside. On 20 May 2003 the latter decided that it had no jurisdiction ratione loci and that the case should be heard by the Hatay Labour Court.\n\nIn a judgment of 21 January 2004 the Hatay Labour Court rejected the applicant’s application in part. Basing its decision on the judgment of the İslahiye District Court, it found that the applicant’s marriage to Ö.K. had not been validated. Accordingly, since the marriage had not been legally recognised, the applicant could not be subrogated to the deceased’s rights. However, the court set aside the fund’s decision in so far as it related to Emine, granting her the benefit of her deceased father’s pension and health insurance rights.\n\nOn 10 February 2004 the applicant appealed on points of law to the Court of Cassation. She pointed out that the extract from the civil register stated that she was the wife of Ö.K., who was registered in the village of Kerküt. The applicant explained that in 1976 she had married Ö.K. in accordance with custom and practice. The couple had had six children, born in 1977, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1985 and 1990. The first five children had been entered in the civil register in 1985 under their father’s name, while the last child, Emine, born in 1990, had been entered under her mother’s name in 2002. The applicant said that on 10 September 2002, while preparations had been under way for an official marriage ceremony, her partner had died following an illness. She asserted that, unlike the couple’s six children, she did not benefit from her late partner’s pension or health insurance rights.\n\nIn a judgment of 3 June 2004, served on the applicant on 28 June 2004, the Court of Cassation upheld the impugned judgment.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 3976/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. By virtue of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention it was also decided to examine the admissibility and the merits of the case at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nThe applicant was the partner of Ömer Koç ([NRP]), with whom she entered into a religious marriage (imam nikah) in [DATE_TIME] and had six children. [PERSON] died on [DATE_TIME].\n\nA. Action before the İslahiye District Court\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant brought an action before the İslahiye District Court, in her own name and that of her daughter [PERSON], seeking to have her marriage to [PERSON] recognised and to have [PERSON] entered in the civil register as the deceased’s daughter.\n\nIn a judgment of [DATE_TIME] the İslahiye District Court dismissed the applicant’s action regarding the marriage but granted the request for [PERSON] to be entered in the register as [PERSON]’s daughter. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final.\n\nB. Application to the Hatay Labour Court\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant requested the Hatay retirement pension fund ([PERSON]) to grant her and her daughter [PERSON] the benefit of her deceased partner’s retirement pension and health insurance rights. On an unspecified date the fund refused the request. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant applied to the İslahiye Labour Court to have that decision set aside. On [DATE_TIME] the latter decided that it had no jurisdiction ratione loci and that the case should be heard by the Hatay Labour Court.\n\nIn a judgment of [DATE_TIME] the Hatay Labour Court rejected the applicant’s application in part. Basing its decision on the judgment of the İslahiye District Court, it found that the applicant’s marriage to [PERSON] had not been validated. Accordingly, since the marriage had not been legally recognised, the applicant could not be subrogated to the deceased’s rights. However, the court set aside the fund’s decision in so far as it related to [PERSON], granting her the benefit of her deceased father’s pension and health insurance rights.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed on points of law to the Court of Cassation. She pointed out that the extract from the civil register stated that she was the wife of [LOCATION], who was registered in the village of [LOCATION]. The applicant explained that in [DATE_TIME] she had married [PERSON] in accordance with custom and practice. The couple had had six children, born in [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The first five children had been entered in the civil register in [DATE_TIME] under their father’s name, while the last child, [PERSON], born in [DATE_TIME], had been entered under her mother’s name in [DATE_TIME]. The applicant said that on [DATE_TIME], while preparations had been under way for an official marriage ceremony, her partner had died following an illness. She asserted that, unlike the couple’s six children, she did not benefit from her late partner’s pension or health insurance rights.\n\nIn a judgment of [DATE_TIME], served on the applicant on [DATE_TIME], the Court of Cassation upheld the impugned judgment.",

Hoş, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 8 July 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning a lack of a fair trial by an impartial and independent tribunal within a reasonable time, a failure to observe the presumption of innocence, a lack of adequate facilities for the preparation of the defence, and a lack of legal assistance during detention. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nBoth the applicants and the Government submitted their observations outside the time limit. They have therefore not been admitted to the case file.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, Mr Adem Kepeneklioğlu and Mr Mehmet Hakan Canpolat, are Turkish nationals, who were born in 1954 and 1964 respectively.

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning a lack of a fair trial by an impartial and independent tribunal within a reasonable time, a failure to observe the presumption of innocence, a lack of adequate facilities for the preparation of the defence, and a lack of legal assistance during detention. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nBoth the applicants and the Government submitted their observations outside the time limit. They have therefore not been admitted to the case file.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1).

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31748/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Eugeniusz Ludwiczak (“the applicant”), on 17 July 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 13 September 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Ostrów Mazowiecka.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn 9 November 1992 the applicant lodged with the Ostrów Mazowiecka District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a claim for payment against his ex-employer, a construction company.\n\nOn the same day the case file was sent to the Warszawa District Court which was competent to deal with the subject-matter.\n\nThe first hearing was scheduled for 22 February 1993. It did not take place because on 21 December 1992 the Warszawa District Court stayed the proceedings due to the fact that on 3 December 1992 winding-up proceedings had been instituted against the defendant.\n\nOn 5 April 1994 the applicant’s claim was entered on the list of claims (lista wierzytelności).\n\nOn 27 May 1994 the Warszawa District Court refused to resume the proceedings.\n\nOn 18 September 2000 the Warszawa District Court was informed that the winding-up proceedings had been discontinued.\n\nThe proceedings were resumed on 6 April 2001. On the same day the case was joined to similar claims lodged against the defendant, and registered under a new reference number. The court adjourned the trial until 1 February 2002.\n\nIt appears that between the date when the proceedings were resumed and the day on which the first-instance judgment was given, no hearing took place. The trial was adjourned 11 times on procedural grounds, such as, for example, the appointment of the defendant’s curator then its liquidator, and the need to supplement the evidence and to appoint an expert.\n\nOn 24 July 2006 the Warszawa District Court, following the applicant’s motion, appointed a lawyer for the applicant.\n\nOn 31 October 2006 the Warszawa District Court gave judgment and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the applicant.\n\nOn 18 December 2006 the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal. It was rejected by the Warszawa District Court on 9 February 2007 on procedural grounds, i.e. failure to pay the so-called “basic court fee” (opłata podstawowa).\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 6 December 2006 the applicant lodged with the Warszawa Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) which entered into force on 17 September 2004. The applicant sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Warszawa District Court had been excessive.\n\nOn 25 January 2007 the Warszawa Regional Court dismissed his complaint. The court examined the course of the impugned proceedings and held that there had been no delays for which the Warszawa District Court could be held responsible, although it admitted that the proceedings had been lengthy.\n\nOn 26 February 2007 the Warszawa Regional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 25 January 2007 as inadmissible in law.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31748/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in Ostrów Mazowiecka.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged with the Ostrów Mazowiecka District Court ([PERSON]) a claim for payment against his ex-employer, a construction company.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the case file was sent to the Warszawa District Court which was competent to deal with the subject-matter.\n\nThe first hearing was scheduled for [DATE_TIME]. It did not take place because on [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa District Court stayed the proceedings due to the fact that on [DATE_TIME] winding-up proceedings had been instituted against the defendant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s claim was entered on the list of claims (lista wierzytelności).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa District Court refused to resume the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa District Court was informed that the winding-up proceedings had been discontinued.\n\nThe proceedings were resumed on [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the case was joined to similar claims lodged against the defendant, and registered under a new reference number. The court adjourned the trial until [DATE_TIME].\n\nIt appears that between the date when the proceedings were resumed and [DATE_TIME] on which the first-instance judgment was given, no hearing took place. The trial was adjourned 11 times on procedural grounds, such as, for example, the appointment of the defendant’s curator then its liquidator, and the need to supplement the evidence and to appoint an expert.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa District Court, following the applicant’s motion, appointed a lawyer for the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa District Court gave judgment and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal. It was rejected by the Warszawa District Court on [DATE_TIME] on procedural grounds, i.e. failure to pay the so-called “basic court fee” (opłata podstawowa).\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged with the Warszawa Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) which entered into force on [DATE_TIME]. The applicant sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Warszawa District Court had been excessive.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa Regional Court dismissed his complaint. The court examined the course of the impugned proceedings and held that there had been no delays for which the Warszawa District Court could be held responsible, although it admitted that the proceedings had been lengthy.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warszawa Regional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the decision of [DATE_TIME] as inadmissible in law.",

Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 19 October 2007 the President of the Chamber decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Tarnów.\n\nOn 9 August 1968 the Hrubieszów District National Council took over the applicant’s farm, regarding it as abandoned property. On 16 January 1969 the Lublin Regional National Council upheld that decision.\n\nOn 12 December 1994 the applicant requested the Minister of Agriculture to declare the latter decision null and void.\n\nOn 29 August 1997 the Minister of Agriculture and Food Economics dismissed the applicant’s request. The applicant appealed. On 9 January 1998 the Minister upheld his former decision.\n\nOn 8 September 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed both decisions of the Minister of Agriculture and Food Economics and remitted the case for re-examination.\n\nOn 4 April 2000 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court requesting that a fine be imposed on the Minister for failure to enforce the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 8 September 1999. He also complained about the overall length of the proceedings. On 9 May 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court discontinued these proceedings since the applicant had withdrawn his complaints as the Minister had in the meantime issued the decision in question (see paragraph 12 below).\n\nThe Minister began to examine the case in June 2000. On 16 June 2000 he stayed the proceedings until certain documents concerning ownership of the applicant’s farm were submitted by the Lublin Governor’s Office. The requested documents were submitted to the Minister on 23 November 2000.\n\nOn 14 March 2001 the applicant lodged another complaint with the Minister of Agriculture and Food Economics alleging inactivity on his part.\n\nOn 26 April 2001 the Minister again dismissed the applicant’s request to declare the decision null and void. On 8 May 2001 the applicant appealed, requesting a re-examination of his case.\n\nOn 21 November 2001 the applicant again lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court alleging inactivity on the part of the Minister. The proceedings were discontinued on 14 March 2002 since the applicant had withdrawn his complaint as the Minister had issued the decision in question (see paragraph 14 below).\n\nOn 8 February 2002 the Minister of Agriculture and Food Economics upheld his decision of 2001.\n\nOn 21 January 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the Minister’s decisions given in 2001 and 2002.\n\nOn 27 January 2004 the Minister dismissed the applicant’s request of 1994 for the third time. On 9 February 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 13017/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Muammer Pakkan (“the applicant”), on 7 March 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Filorinalı and Ms Y. Başara, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 13 October 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and is currently detained on remand in the Edirne F-type prison.\n\nOn 28 November 1992 the applicant was taken into police custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Istanbul Security Directorate. On 10 December 1992 the Istanbul State Security Court ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 5 January 1993 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant and twenty-nine others, charging them with membership of an illegal left-wing organisation, contrary to Article 146 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Law on Prevention of Terrorism.\n\nAt the hearing of 22 November 1993 before the Istanbul State Security Court, which included a military judge, the accused protested against the proceedings by shouting slogans in the hearing room. Following the intervention of the security forces, they broke the windows of the court building.\n\nAt the hearings held between 1993 and 1994 the court heard the testimony of several witnesses and took the statements of the accused.\n\nOn 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.\n\nAt the end of almost every hearing the court dismissed the applicant’s request to be released pending trial and ordered his continued detention on remand, having regard to the nature of the offence and the content of the case file. At the hearings during which the applicant was absent the court considered his situation of its own motion and ordered his detention on remand, relying on the same reasons.\n\nAt the hearing of 27 March 2000 the court finished taking the final statements of almost all the accused including the applicant and stated that no additional time would be given to those who had not yet submitted their final observations.\n\nOn 30 July 2001 the applicant filed a petition with a different chamber of the Istanbul State Security Court, complaining about the court’s order for his continued remand in custody. On 1 August 2001 his objection was dismissed on account of the nature of the offence and the content of the case file.\n\nBy 12 October 2001 fifty-five hearings had been held before the Istanbul State Security Court and the judges on the bench of the court had been changed on six occasions.\n\nState Security Courts were abolished by constitutional amendments introduced on 7 May 2004. As a result, all of the procedural safeguards provided for by the ordinary criminal procedure henceforth became applicable to all proceedings without exception.\n\nOn 27 October 2004 the Istanbul Assize Court found the applicant guilty of the charges and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 13 July 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the State Security Court on procedural grounds.\n\nThe case is still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court and the applicant is still in detention on remand. The latest hearing was held on 2 December 2005.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and is currently detained on remand in the Edirne F-type prison.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was taken into police custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Istanbul Security Directorate. On [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul State Security Court ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant and twenty-nine others, charging them with membership of an illegal left-wing organisation, contrary to Article 146 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Law on Prevention of Terrorism.\n\nAt the hearing of [DATE_TIME] before the Istanbul State Security Court, which included a military judge, the accused protested against the proceedings by shouting slogans in the hearing room. Following the intervention of the security forces, they broke the windows of the court building.\n\nAt the hearings held [DATE_TIME] the court heard the testimony of several witnesses and took the statements of the accused.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Constitution was amended and the military judges sitting on the bench of State Security Courts were replaced by civilian judges.\n\nAt the end of almost every hearing the court dismissed the applicant’s request to be released pending trial and ordered his continued detention on remand, having regard to the nature of the offence and the content of the case file. At the hearings during which the applicant was absent the court considered his situation of its own motion and ordered his detention on remand, relying on the same reasons.\n\nAt the hearing of [DATE_TIME] the court finished taking the final statements of almost all the accused including the applicant and stated that no additional time would be given to those who had not yet submitted their final observations.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed a petition with a different chamber of the Istanbul State Security Court, complaining about the court’s order for his continued remand in custody. On [DATE_TIME] his objection was dismissed on account of the nature of the offence and the content of the case file.\n\nBy [DATE_TIME] fifty-five hearings had been held before the Istanbul State Security Court and the judges on the bench of the court had been changed on six occasions.\n\nState Security Courts were abolished by constitutional amendments introduced on [DATE_TIME]. As a result, all of the procedural safeguards provided for by the ordinary criminal procedure henceforth became applicable to all proceedings without exception.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul Assize Court found the applicant guilty of the charges and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the State Security Court on procedural grounds.\n\nThe case is still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court and the applicant is still in detention on remand. The latest hearing was held on [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35785/07) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Bogusław Tekiela (“the applicant”), on 23 July 2007.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 3 April 2008 the President of the Fourth Section gave notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Ostrów Wielkopolski.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for damages\n\nOn 3 February 2003 the applicant instituted civil proceedings for damages against W.U. before the Kielce Regional Court. On 4 February 2003 the case was transferred to the Kraków Regional Court. Hearings before that court were held on 8 May, 3 July, 14 and 23 October 2003. On the last date the court assigned an expert to prepare a report which was submitted to the court on 31 December 2003. Further hearings were scheduled for 20 April and 25 May 2004.\n\nBy a judgment of 8 June 2004 the applicant’s claim was dismissed. On 1 December 2004 the appellate court quashed the first-instance judgment and the case was remitted.\n\nA hearing was held on 11 March 2005. On 2 May 2005 the Regional Court admitted evidence based on an expert opinion. The expert’s report was submitted to the court on 19 July 2005. As the parties objected, the court decided that a new expert should be found. However, it could not find one competent to examine the issues involved in the case.\n\nOn 29 September 2005 the applicant complained that the proceedings were too lengthy. In October 2005 the court took steps to find an expert, to no avail.\n\nUltimately the court decided that two experts should give their opinion as it was impossible to find one competent to deal with all aspects of the case. One expert was found and the task of preparing a partial opinion was assigned to him. On 27 January 2006 the case file was sent to him. Another expert was asked to prepare an opinion to complete the first one after he had received the case file with the first report. The full report was submitted to the court on 4 September 2006.\n\nOn 2 and 3 October 2006 the parties filed their objections concerning the report. On 19 February and 27 March 2007 hearings were held. On the latter date the applicant modified and extended his claim. The next hearing was scheduled for 8 April 2007. On 23 May 2007 the court gave a judgment and allowed the applicant’s claim in part.\n\nThe parties appealed. On 21 November 2007 the Kraków Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals. In February 2008 both parties lodged cassation appeals with the Supreme Court. The case is currently pending before that court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant filed, under the Law of 17 June 2004 (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), a complaint about the breach of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. He also claimed compensation for the excessive length of the proceedings.\n\nOn 29 January 2007 the Kraków Court of Appeal found that from October 2005 until January 2006 the Regional Court had failed to conduct the proceedings expeditiously. It dismissed the applicant’s request to be awarded compensation and ordered the Regional Court to give a judgment on the merits of the case before July 2007.\n\nOn 2 April 2007 the court rejected the applicant’s appeal against this decision, finding that no appeal was available in law against it.",

On [DATE_TIME] the appellate court quashed the first-instance judgment and the case was remitted.\n\nA hearing was held on [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court admitted evidence based on an expert opinion. The expert’s report was submitted to the court on [DATE_TIME]. As the parties objected, the court decided that a new expert should be found. However, it could not find one competent to examine the issues involved in the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant complained that the proceedings were too lengthy. In [DATE_TIME] the court took steps to find an expert, to no avail.\n\nUltimately the court decided that two experts should give their opinion as it was impossible to find one competent to deal with all aspects of the case. One expert was found and the task of preparing a partial opinion was assigned to him. On [DATE_TIME] the case file was sent to him. Another expert was asked to prepare an opinion to complete the first one after he had received the case file with the first report. The full report was submitted to the court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn 2 and [DATE_TIME] the parties filed their objections concerning the report. On [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] hearings were held. On the latter date the applicant modified and extended his claim. The next hearing was scheduled for [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the court gave a judgment and allowed the applicant’s claim in part.\n\nThe parties appealed. On [DATE_TIME] the Kraków Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals. In [DATE_TIME] both parties lodged cassation appeals with the Supreme Court. The case is currently pending before that court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant filed, under the Law of [DATE_TIME] ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), a complaint about the breach of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. He also claimed compensation for the excessive length of the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Kraków Court of Appeal found that from [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court had failed to conduct the proceedings expeditiously. It dismissed the applicant’s request to be awarded compensation and ordered the Regional Court to give a judgment on the merits of the case before [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court rejected the applicant’s appeal against this decision, finding that no appeal was available in law against it.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 49788/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Krzysztof Kaniewski (“the applicant”), on 5 December 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 21 February 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike the application out of the list, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for dissolution of a partnership\n\nOn 6 November 1992 the applicant lodged a claim with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sad Okręgowy) for dissolution of a partnership.\n\nOn 6 June 1995 the proceedings were stayed.\n\nOn 26 September 1996 the Warsaw Regional Court discontinued the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision.\n\nOn an unspecified date the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) quashed the decision on the discontinuance of the proceedings.\n\nOn 23 July 1997 the Warsaw Regional Court found that it was not competent to deal with the matter and referred the case to the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy).\n\nBetween 26 February 1998 and 2 September 2002 the court scheduled eight hearings, two of which were adjourned.\n\nOn 2 September 2002 the court ordered that an expert report be obtained.\n\nBetween 25 November 2002 and June 2003 the expert witness prepared his report.\n\nOn 8 April 2004 the proceedings were stayed. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 16 August 2004 the court rejected the applicant’s appeal.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending before the Warsaw District Court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 14 June 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn 29 September 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed his complaint on the ground that on the date of the entry into force of the 2004 Act no undue delays in the court’s conduct could be discerned. The court acknowledged that the proceedings before 2004 had been unreasonably lengthy for various reasons such as the failure of witnesses and lawyers to appear on numerous occasions and the unreasonably long period taken up by the preparation of a report by the expert witness. The court also found some periods of inactivity on the part of the Warsaw District Court (between 18 November 1998 and 24 September 1999 and between 9 December 1999 and 29 October 2001). However, the court stressed that the 2004 Act had entered into force on 17 September 2004 and could not be applied to the proceedings occurring before that date. Having analysed the conduct of the District Court in the period following the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the Regional Court found that the proceedings had been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 49788/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike the application out of the list, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Civil proceedings for dissolution of a partnership\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a claim with the Warsaw Regional Court ([PERSON]) for dissolution of a partnership.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the proceedings were stayed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court discontinued the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision.\n\nOn an unspecified date the Warsaw Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) quashed the decision on the discontinuance of the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court found that it was not competent to deal with the matter and referred the case to the Warsaw District Court ([PERSON]).\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the court scheduled eight hearings, two of which were adjourned.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ordered that an expert report be obtained.\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the expert witness prepared his report.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the proceedings were stayed. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court rejected the applicant’s appeal.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending before the Warsaw District Court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed his complaint on the ground that on the date of the entry into force of the 2004 Act no undue delays in the court’s conduct could be discerned. The court acknowledged that the proceedings before [DATE_TIME] had been unreasonably lengthy for various reasons such as the failure of witnesses and lawyers to appear on numerous occasions and the unreasonably long period taken up by the preparation of a report by the expert witness. The court also found some periods of inactivity on the part of the Warsaw District Court (between 18 November 1998 and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]). However, the court stressed that the 2004 Act had entered into force on [DATE_TIME] and could not be applied to the proceedings occurring before that date. Having analysed the conduct of the District Court in the period following the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the Regional Court found that the proceedings had been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 14450/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Maciej Maksym (“the applicant”), on 25 April 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 9 May 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate ex officio the issue of the possible monitoring of the applicant's correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Gliwice, Poland.\n\nA. The criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nThe applicant was the owner of a company in Gdańsk (Agencja Rozwoju Przedsiębiorczości i Inwestycji w Gdańsku). On 8 April 1999 he was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On 10 April 1999 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 21 May 1999 the applicant began serving a 3 years and 10 months' prison sentence, which resulted from another conviction.\n\nOn 9 January 2000 the Gdańsk District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 3 years and 6 months' imprisonment.\n\nOn 18 October 2001 the Gdańsk Regional Court upheld the applicant's conviction.\n\nOn 9 May 2002 the applicant was again arrested on suspicion of fraud. On 10 May 2002 the Olsztyn District Court ordered his detention on remand. On 16 September 2002 the Olsztyn District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 3 years' imprisonment.\n\nUpon the applicant's appeal, the Olsztyn Regional Court amended the first‑instance judgment on 30 January 2003. The applicant filed a cassation appeal. On 1 March 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's cassation appeal as manifestly ill‑founded.\n\nB. The monitoring of the applicant's correspondence\n\nAt the time of lodging his application with the Court the applicant had been detained on remand in the course of criminal proceedings against him. At the same time, as of 21 May 1999 he was serving a prison sentence imposed in the course of another set of criminal proceedings against him.\n\nOn 6 June 2000, the Registry of the Court received the applicant's letter dated 12 April 2000. Both the letter and the envelope bear a stamp “Censored on... judge” and no signature (Cenzurowano dn... sędzia.). The envelope had been opened and then sealed with adhesive tape.\n\nOn 13 February 2001, the Registry of the Court received another letter from the applicant (dated 29 December 2000). It was delivered in an envelope bearing a stamp “Censored on ... judge” and no signature (Cenzurowano dn... sędzia.). It also bears a red stamp “Remand Centre in Gdańsk” (Areszt Śledczy w Gdańsku).\n\nOn 25 June 2001, the Registry of the Court received another letter from the applicant, dated 24 July 2000 (sent on 13 June 2001). It was delivered in an envelope bearing a stamp “Censored on... judge” and no signature (Cenzurowano dn... sędzia.). The envelope had been sealed with adhesive tape. It also bears a handwritten note: “letter admitted to transport sealed with adhesive tape” (list przyjęty do przewozu oklejony taśmą).",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 34400/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Volkan Şahin (“the applicant”), on 6 August 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Ayhan Akyiğit, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 May 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect, as well as the complaint concerning non-communication to the applicant of the submissions of the principal public prosecutor. On 8 September 2006 it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time, pursuant to Article 29 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Antalya.\n\nOn 23 March 1993 a certain H.I. lodged a criminal complaint with the Marmaris public prosecutor against the applicant and a certain S.K., accusing them of forging a bond. The prosecutor initiated an investigation and questioned the applicant on 17 May 1993.\n\nOnce the preliminary investigation was completed and the necessary evidence was obtained, a prosecutor in Ankara filed an indictment with the Ankara Assize Court (hereinafter “the trial court”) on 21 April 1995 and requested that the applicant and S.K. be punished in accordance with Article 342 § 1 of the Criminal Code for the offence of forgery.\n\nThirteen hearings were held by the trial court between 1 May 1995 and 12 September 1997 in the absence of the applicant. At each of these hearings the trial court noted the authorities’ failure to locate the applicant’s address. According to the applicant, the reason for his absence from those hearings was that he had not been informed about the trial. On 13 May 1996 the applicant’s co-accused S.K. was acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence. The trial court decided to continue the proceedings against the applicant.\n\nA lawyer representing the applicant attended the 14th hearing on 21 November 1997 but, as the applicant was unable to pay his fees, the lawyer discontinued representing him. On 26 March 1998 the authorities were able to find the applicant and question him. In the course of the questioning the applicant denied the accusations against him. He attended the 18th hearing, held on 28 May 1998.\n\nDuring the 19th hearing, held on 22 June 1998, the trial court acquitted the applicant for lack of sufficient evidence. On 16 September 1998 the public prosecutor appealed against the acquittal. On 11 November 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision and referred the case to the trial court for a new trial.\n\nOn 11 April 2000, during its first hearing in the new trial, the trial court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to one year and eight months’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 22 October 2001 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written observations to the Court of Cassation. These observations were not communicated to the applicant. On 13 February 2002, after having held a hearing, the Court of Cassation upheld the trial court’s decision.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the length of the proceedings and the lack of remedies in that respect, as well as the complaint concerning non-communication to the applicant of the submissions of the principal public prosecutor. On [DATE_TIME] it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time, pursuant to Article 29 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a certain H.I. lodged a criminal complaint with the [LOCATION] public prosecutor against the applicant and a certain S.K., accusing them of forging a bond. The prosecutor initiated an investigation and questioned the applicant on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOnce the preliminary investigation was completed and the necessary evidence was obtained, a prosecutor in [LOCATION] filed an indictment with the Ankara Assize Court (hereinafter “the trial court”) on [DATE_TIME] and requested that the applicant and [PERSON] be punished in accordance with Article 342 § 1 of the Criminal Code for the offence of forgery.\n\nThirteen hearings were held by the trial court [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] in the absence of the applicant. At each of these hearings the trial court noted the authorities’ failure to locate the applicant’s address. According to the applicant, the reason for his absence from those hearings was that he had not been informed about the trial. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s co-accused [PERSON] was acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence. The trial court decided to continue the proceedings against the applicant.\n\nA lawyer representing the applicant attended the 14th hearing on [DATE_TIME] but, as the applicant was unable to pay his fees, the lawyer discontinued representing him. On [DATE_TIME] the authorities were able to find the applicant and question him. In the course of the questioning the applicant denied the accusations against him. He attended the 18th hearing, held on [DATE_TIME].\n\nDuring the 19th hearing, held on [DATE_TIME], the trial court acquitted the applicant for lack of sufficient evidence. On [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor appealed against the acquittal. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the decision and referred the case to the trial court for a new trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], during its first hearing in the new trial, the trial court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written observations to the Court of Cassation. These observations were not communicated to the applicant. On [DATE_TIME], after having held a hearing, the Court of Cassation upheld the trial court’s decision.",

The applicant was represented by Mr K.T. Sürek, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 28 August 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicant's right to be released pending judicial proceedings and to a fair hearing within a reasonable time to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 20 August 1996 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP‑C (Devrimci Halk Kurtuluş Partisi-Cephesi; the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front), as well as aiding and abetting the said organisation.\n\nOn 3 September 1996 the applicant was remanded in custody.\n\nOn 6 December 1996 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with other persons, charging him with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 § 1 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn 20 May 2002 the Istanbul State Security Court found the applicant guilty of activities carried out for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory. The applicant was sentenced to death; his sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to specify the provision of the Criminal Code under which the applicant had been found guilty. The Court of Cassation held that the applicant had been unlawfully held accountable for an event which had not been included in the bill of indictment of 6 December 1996.\n\nBy Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant was therefore transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.\n\nOn 31 March 2006 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nAccording to the information in the case file, the case is still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court.",

It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP‑C ([PERSON] Kurtuluş Partisi-Cephesi; the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front), as well as aiding and abetting the said organisation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was remanded in custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with other persons, charging him with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 § 1 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul State Security Court found the applicant guilty of activities carried out for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory. The applicant was sentenced to death; his sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to specify the provision of the Criminal Code under which the applicant had been found guilty. The Court of Cassation held that the applicant had been unlawfully held accountable for an event which had not been included in the bill of indictment of [DATE_TIME].\n\nBy Law no. 5190 of [DATE_TIME], published in the Official Gazette on [DATE_TIME], State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant was therefore transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nAccording to the information in the case file, the case is still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 11184/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Ewa Krempa-Czuchryta (“the applicant”), on 10 September 2001.\n\nThe applicant was not legally represented. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 26 June 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Lublin.\n\nA. Facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nOn 2 May 1990 the applicant asked the Rzeszów District Court to declare that she had been the beneficiary of an inheritance from a certain M.K. on the basis of a will made before a notary on 24 February 1975.\n\nOn 27 September 1990 the other party to the proceedings, a certain W.B., lodged her own inheritance claim and asked the same court to declare that she had received an inheritance from her sister – M.K. – on the basis of the above-mentioned will made before a notary on 21 November 1988.\n\nOn 12 November 1990 a hearing was held. The applicant asked for the annulment of a will made on 21 November 1988 in favour W.B.\n\nOn 15 March 1991 a psychiatric opinion (opinia sądowo‑psychiatryczna) concerning the testator's state of health between 1975 and 1988 was obtained.\n\nAt hearings scheduled between 1 October 1992 and 1 February 1993 evidence was heard from over 20 witnesses.\n\nB. Facts after 30 April 1993\n\nOn 29 October 1994 the court obtained a second psychiatric opinion prepared by an expert from the Lublin Medical Academy (Akademia Medyczna).\n\nOn 10 February 1995 the Rzeszów District Court asked the Poznań Medical Academy for an expert report to be prepared by the Institute of Psychiatry – the so-called “institute opinion” (opinia instytucjonalna).\n\nOn 20 April 1995 the Poznań Medical Academy informed the Rzeszów District Court about the state of preparation of the report.\n\nOn 10 July 1995 the Poznań Medical Academy informed the Rzeszów District Court that, due to the holiday season, it was not possible to prepare the above-mentioned “institute opinion”. It asked the Rzeszów District Court whether it would accept an expert opinion given by two experts in psychiatry.\n\nOn 21 July 1995 the President of the Rzeszów District Court agreed.\n\nThe opinion was submitted on 8 May 1996.\n\nThe fourth expert's report in the case was submitted on 24 September 1997.\n\nAt a hearing held on 23 December 1997 the Rzeszów District Court gave a decision. It was served on the applicant's lawyer on 27 January 1998.\n\nOn 24 February 1998 the applicant appealed.\n\nThe appeal was dismissed by the Rzeszów Regional Court on 12 May 1998. The decision was served on the applicant on 15 June 1998.\n\nOn 14 July 1998 the applicant's lawyer lodged a cassation appeal. It was referred to the Supreme Court on 29 October 1998.\n\nOn 13 March 2001 the Supreme Court refused to entertain the cassation appeal as no important legal issue arose in the case.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 59285/12) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Tomasz Romaniuk (“the applicant”), on 3 September 2012.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Osik, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, a breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition on him of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime.\n\nOn 7 July 2014 the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Sokołów Podlaski.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 8 April 2009 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody. He was charged with, inter alia, murder, attempted murder, and illegal possession of firearms.\n\nOn 2 December 2011 the Ostrołęka Regional Court convicted the applicant of battery and attempted murder and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment.\n\nOn 25 October 2012 the Białystok Court of Appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment.\n\nOn 8 November 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal.\n\nB. Imposition of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn 10 April 2009 the Czerwony Bór Prison Penitentiary Commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. It considered that it was necessary to place him in a cell for dangerous detainees as he had been charged with murder committed with the use of firearms. The commission referred to the applicant’s “personal circumstances and serious lack of moral character”. The applicant did not appeal against the decision.\n\nBetween 7 July 2009 and 7 January 2010, the commission reviewed its decision every three months. In renewing its decision to classify the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”, the commission reiterated the same reasoning, which read as follows: “His characteristics, personal circumstances, serious lack of moral character and [the fact of] being charged with offences committed with the use of a firearm, pose a serious danger to society and to the security of the remand centre.”\n\nThe reasoning given on 5 April, 30 June and 30 September 2011 differed slightly in that gave a detailed description of the offences with which the applicant had been charged as the grounds for extending the regime. The commission referred to the offences of murder and three attempts to commit murder with the use of a firearm.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 30 September 2011.\n\nOn 13 December 2011 the Białystok Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn 29 December 2011 the commission extended the application of the “dangerous detainee” regime to the applicant for the eleventh time. The reasoning given was the same as in the decisions of 2009.\n\nOn 29 March 2012 the commission lifted the “dangerous detainee” regime in respect of the applicant. It considered that, on the basis of the relevant documentation and the assessment of the applicant’s behaviour, he no longer posed a danger to society or to the security of the remand centre.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 59285/12) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON], of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, a breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition on him of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION] Podlaski.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody. He was charged with, inter alia, murder, attempted murder, and illegal possession of firearms.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ostrołęka Regional Court convicted the applicant of battery and attempted murder and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Białystok Court of Appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal.\n\nB. Imposition of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Czerwony Bór Prison Penitentiary Commission (“the commission”) classified the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. It considered that it was necessary to place him in a cell for dangerous detainees as he had been charged with murder committed with the use of firearms. The commission referred to the applicant’s “personal circumstances and serious lack of moral character”. The applicant did not appeal against the decision.\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the commission reviewed its decision [DATE_TIME]. In renewing its decision to classify the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”, the commission reiterated the same reasoning, which read as follows: “His characteristics, personal circumstances, serious lack of moral character and [the fact of] being charged with offences committed with the use of a firearm, pose a serious danger to society and to the security of the remand centre.”\n\nThe reasoning given on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] differed slightly in that gave a detailed description of the offences with which the applicant had been charged as the grounds for extending the regime. The commission referred to the offences of murder and three attempts to commit murder with the use of a firearm.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Białystok Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the commission extended the application of the “dangerous detainee” regime to the applicant for the eleventh time. The reasoning given was the same as in the decisions of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the commission lifted the “dangerous detainee” regime in respect of the applicant. It considered that, on the basis of the relevant documentation and the assessment of the applicant’s behaviour, he no longer posed a danger to society or to the security of the remand centre.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 2311/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Małgorzata Kuczkowska (“the applicant”), on 22 December 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms M. Gąsiorowska, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 16 November 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn 3 June 1991 the applicant instituted civil proceedings for dissolution of a co-ownership and division of an inheritance before the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). On 18 November 1992 the case was transmitted to the Pruszków District Court.\n\nBetween 24 February 1993 and 28 May 2003 the court held 18 hearings.\n\nOn 7 June 2004 the Pruszków District Court gave a partial decision in the case. The court held that, following further proceedings, a final decision concerning the distribution of the estate would be given at a later stage. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 9 June 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court, having examined the partial decision, remitted the case to the District Court.\n\nAccording to the applicant’s submissions, from June 2005 until March 2006 no hearing was listed in her case.\n\nOn 22 August 2007 the Pruszków District Court gave a decision and divided the inheritance. It is unclear whether the applicant appealed against that decision.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn 8 March 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court rejected her complaint for a procedural mistake.\n\nOn 11 April 2005 the applicant again lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the 2004 Act. She sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Pruszków District Court had been excessive and that just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN - approx. EUR 2,500) should be awarded to her.\n\nOn 9 June 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings, finding that there had been some periods of unjustified inactivity (lasting from several months to some two years) on the part of the Pruszków District Court and awarded the applicant PLN 3,000 (approx. EUR 738) in just satisfaction. Referring to the amount of just satisfaction, the court relied on the fact that the applicant and other parties to the proceedings had contributed to their length and that after 2003 the proceedings had been considerably accelerated.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 2311/04) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant instituted civil proceedings for dissolution of a co-ownership and division of an inheritance before the Warsaw District Court ([PERSON]). On [DATE_TIME] the case was transmitted to the Pruszków District Court.\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the court held 18 hearings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Pruszków District Court gave a partial decision in the case. The court held that, following further proceedings, a final decision concerning the distribution of the estate would be given at a later stage. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court, having examined the partial decision, remitted the case to the District Court.\n\nAccording to the applicant’s submissions, from [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME] no hearing was listed in her case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Pruszków District Court gave a decision and divided the inheritance. It is unclear whether the applicant appealed against that decision.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy), under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court rejected her complaint for a procedural mistake.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant again lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the 2004 Act. She sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Pruszków District Court had been excessive and that just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN - approx. EUR 2,500) should be awarded to her.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings, finding that there had been some periods of unjustified inactivity (lasting from [DATE_TIME]) on the part of the Pruszków District Court and awarded the applicant PLN 3,000 (approx. EUR 738) in just satisfaction. Referring to the amount of just satisfaction, the court relied on the fact that the applicant and other parties to the proceedings had contributed to their length and that after [DATE_TIME] the proceedings had been considerably accelerated.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1524/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Zbigniew Majchrzak (“the applicant”), on 23 June 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 September 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Poznań, Poland.\n\n1. The facts prior to 1 May 1993\n\nW.M., the applicant’s father died intestate in 1988. In November 1990, P.M., the applicant’s mother, requested the Poznań District Court to declare that she and her three children, including the applicant, were entitled to inherit from W.M.\n\nIn the course of those proceedings, the applicant’s mother, who had made three different wills, died in 1992. Consequently, on 9 March 1992 the applicant requested to join the case concerning the persons entitled to inherit from his mother to the original proceedings.\n\nThe District Court held 6 hearings in 1992.\n\n2. The facts after 1 May 1993\n\nThe District Court held 4 hearings on the following dates: 27 September 1993; 4 August and 28 October 1994; and 2 October 1995.\n\nOn 11 February 1994 the court ordered that evidence from an expert be obtained. The expert report was served on the parties on 18 March 1994. On 28 October 1994 the court ordered that evidence from a handwriting expert be obtained. The expert report was submitted to the court on 7 June 1995.\n\nOn 16 October 1995 the Poznań District Court gave its decision (postanowienie). It ruled that the estate of W.M. should pass, according to the relevant statute, to the applicant’s mother, the applicant, his sister (B.K.) and W.M.’s granddaughter. In respect of the persons entitled to inherit from the applicant’s mother, the District Court held that her entire estate should pass to the applicant’s sister on the basis of the will made in 1990. The applicant appealed against the District Court’s decision.\n\nOn 27 February 1996 the Poznań Regional Court quashed the District Court’s decision on the persons entitled to inherit from the applicant’s mother and accordingly, remitted the case in part. It found that the first-instance proceedings in that respect had been null and void on the ground that M.M. (the applicant’s daughter), who had a legal interest in the case, had not been summoned to participate in the proceedings. The Regional Court upheld the remainder of the first-instance decision.\n\nIn the subsequent proceedings the District Court held 8 hearings on the following dates: 7 January, 26 September and 28 November 1997; 12 May, 21 August and 22 December 1998; and 8 and 22 February 1999.\n\nOn 18 March 1999 the Poznań District Court ruled that B.K. (the applicant’s sister) was the only person entitled to inherit from the applicant’s mother in accordance with the 1990 will. The applicant appealed against the District Court’s decision.\n\nThe Poznań Regional Court held a hearing on 9 November 1999. On 26 November 1999 it quashed the decision and remitted the case.\n\nOn 2 January 2001 the Poznan District Court held the first and the only hearing. On the same day it held in a decision that the only person entitled to inherit from P.M., the applicant’s mother, was M.M. (the applicant’s daughter) in accordance with the will made in 1988. It appears that none of the parties appealed against that decision.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1524/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON], of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\n1. The facts prior to 1 [DATE_TIME]\n\nW.M., the applicant’s father died intestate in [DATE_TIME]. In [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], the applicant’s mother, requested the Poznań District Court to declare that she and her three children, including the applicant, were entitled to inherit from [LOCATION]\n\nIn the course of those proceedings, the applicant’s mother, who had made three different wills, died in [DATE_TIME]. Consequently, on [DATE_TIME] the applicant requested to join the case concerning the persons entitled to inherit from his mother to the original proceedings.\n\nThe District Court held 6 hearings in [DATE_TIME].\n\n2. The facts after [DATE_TIME]\n\nThe District Court held 4 hearings on the following dates: [DATE_TIME]; [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]; and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ordered that evidence from an expert be obtained. The expert report was served on the parties on [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the court ordered that evidence from a handwriting expert be obtained. The expert report was submitted to the court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań District Court gave its decision (postanowienie). It ruled that the estate of W.M. should pass, according to the relevant statute, to the applicant’s mother, the applicant, his sister ([PERSON]) and W.M.’s granddaughter. In respect of the persons entitled to inherit from the applicant’s mother, the District Court held that her entire estate should pass to the applicant’s sister on the basis of the will made in [DATE_TIME]. The applicant appealed against the District Court’s decision.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Regional Court quashed the District Court’s decision on the persons entitled to inherit from the applicant’s mother and accordingly, remitted the case in part. It found that the first-instance proceedings in that respect had been null and void on the ground that [PERSON] (the applicant’s daughter), who had a legal interest in the case, had not been summoned to participate in the proceedings. The Regional Court upheld the remainder of the first-instance decision.\n\nIn the subsequent proceedings the District Court held 8 hearings on the following dates: [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]; [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]; and 8 and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań District Court ruled that [PERSON] (the applicant’s sister) was the only person entitled to inherit from the applicant’s mother in accordance with the [DATE_TIME] will. The applicant appealed against the District Court’s decision.\n\nThe Poznań Regional Court held a hearing on [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] it quashed the decision and remitted the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznan District Court held the first and the only hearing. On [DATE_TIME] it held in a decision that the only person entitled to inherit from [DATE_TIME], the applicant’s mother, was [PERSON] (the applicant’s daughter) in accordance with the will made in [DATE_TIME]. It appears that none of the parties appealed against that decision.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 63442/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Henryk Kuśmierkowski (“the applicant”), on 11 April 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and Mr. J. Wołąsiewicz.\n\nOn 10 July 2001 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Dębno, Poland.\n\nIn 1989 the applicant was injured in a traffic accident. Later, a medical board assessed his disability as being of the first degree (serious) and he was granted a disability pension. The applicant also applied to PZU S.A., an insurance company, for a monthly allowance compensating him for his loss of ability to work (renta uzupełniająca). The company refused his request.\n\nOn 14 May 1991 the applicant sued PZU S.A. in the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki), seeking an award of a monthly allowance. On 23 November 1992 the court partly granted his claim. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 19 May 1993 the Poznań Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) partly quashed the contested judgment and remitted the case.\n\nThe Regional Court held hearings on 13 January and 25 August 1994. At the hearing held on 27 October 1994 the applicant modified his claim. On 24 March 1995 the trial court asked the applicant to specify his claim. On 9 May 1995 the applicant submitted to the court his modified statement of claim.\n\nThe court held hearings on 8 June 1995, 7 December 1995 and 29 February 1996. On 5 April 1996 the court ordered an expert opinion. It was submitted to the court on 31 May 1996. On 17 July 1996 the court ordered an opinion from yet another expert. The expert submitted it to the court on 27 July 1996.\n\nThe court held a hearing on 20 February 1997. The hearing scheduled for 22 May 1997 was cancelled. On 15 December 1997 a supplementary opinion was submitted to the court.\n\nFurther hearings were held on 29 January 1998 and 20 April 1999. On 17 June 1999 yet another supplementary expert opinion was submitted to the court. On 4 November 1999 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 18 November 1999 the Regional Court gave judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed. On 13 June 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. The judgment is final.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 33176/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Sebastian Gulczyński (“the applicant”), on 8 August 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms A. Pietras, a lawyer practising in Gdynia. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wolasiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 27 September 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Gdańsk.\n\nOn 2 March 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and theft committed as part of an organised criminal gang.\n\nOn 3 March 2003 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) ordered his pre-trial detention. It referred to the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would obstruct the investigation by inducing witnesses to give false testimony.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Regional Court several times. The court referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case. It relied on the fact that there were no circumstances to justify the application of a different preventive measure.\n\nOn 20 November 2003 the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) indicted the applicant together with 13 other persons on charges of armed robbery, fraud, destruction of documents and theft committed as part of an organised criminal gang. The prosecutor asked the court to hear evidence from at least 120 witnesses.\n\nThe trial began on 17 March 2004. The trial court held on average three hearings per month.\n\nIn the course of the trial the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Regional Court and the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) several times. The court relied on the previous grounds. It also referred to the need to conclude the proceedings and in particular to ensure that the numerous co-accused and witnesses were questioned.\n\nThe applicant’s appeals against the decisions extending his detention and against the detention order, and all his subsequent, numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.\n\nIn particular, on 31 July 2006 the applicant made an application for his detention to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. He referred to the fact that his role in the organised criminal gang had been marginal and that the process of obtaining evidence had been successfully completed. On 17 August 2006 the Regional Court dismissed the application.\n\nOn 15 November 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. The judgment became final, as on 28 November 2006 the applicant informed the Gdańsk Regional Court that he would not appeal.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 33176/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and theft committed as part of an organised criminal gang.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) ordered his pre-trial detention. It referred to the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would obstruct the investigation by inducing witnesses to give false testimony.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Regional Court several times. The court referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case. It relied on the fact that there were no circumstances to justify the application of a different preventive measure.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor ([PERSON]) indicted the applicant together with 13 other persons on charges of armed robbery, fraud, destruction of documents and theft committed as part of an organised criminal gang. The prosecutor asked the court to hear evidence from at least 120 witnesses.\n\nThe trial began on [DATE_TIME]. The trial court held on average three hearings per month.\n\nIn the course of the trial the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Regional Court and the Gdańsk Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) several times. The court relied on the previous grounds. It also referred to the need to conclude the proceedings and in particular to ensure that the numerous co-accused and witnesses were questioned.\n\nThe applicant’s appeals against the decisions extending his detention and against the detention order, and all his subsequent, numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.\n\nIn particular, on [DATE_TIME] the applicant made an application for his detention to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. He referred to the fact that his role in the organised criminal gang had been marginal and that the process of obtaining evidence had been successfully completed. On [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court dismissed the application.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The judgment became final, as on [DATE_TIME] the applicant informed the Gdańsk Regional Court that he would not appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 7945/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Özgür Uyanık and Mr Ozan Kabadayı (“the applicants”), on 8 February 2005. The applicants were detained on remand in Kartal Prison, İstanbul, when they lodged the case.\n\nOn 27 March 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the applicants’ complaints concerning the length of their detention and the length of the criminal proceedings brought against them. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 8 July 2008 the Government submitted their observations which were sent to Mr. E. Olcaytu, the applicants’ lawyer practicing in Istanbul, who was requested to submit his replies to the Government’s observations and just satisfaction claims. The Registry did not receive a reply.\n\nBy a letter dated 23 February 2009, Mr V. Gültaş, a lawyer practising in Izmir, informed the Court that Mr Olcaytu no longer practised law and he was the new representative. Upon the Registry’s subsequent request, Mr Gültaş presented a power of attorney in respect of the first applicant. Consequently, on 31 March 2009, the Registry sent the case file to Mr Gültaş (by fax and mail) and to the second applicant in Kartal Prison, setting a new time limit for their replies to the Government’s observations and just satisfaction claims. The Registry has not received a reply from either the first applicant’s new representative or the second applicant.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nOn 16 May 1996 the applicants were arrested and taken into police custody by officers of the İstanbul security police in connection with an investigation into an illegal organisation. On 30 May 1996 the applicants were brought before the İstanbul public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively, who remanded the applicants in custody.\n\nBy an indictment dated 27 June 1996, the public prosecutor at the İstanbul State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants and a number of others, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of taking part in its activities.\n\nOn 4 June 2003 the İstanbul State Security Court sentenced the applicants to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code. On 20 January 2004 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and remitted the case. State Security Courts were abolished by constitutional amendments introduced on 7 May 2004. Subsequently, the applicants’ case was resumed before the 12th Assize Court of İstanbul.\n\nReferring to recent amendments in domestic law, on 27 December 2004 the applicants requested to be released pending trial. Relying on the accusations against the applicants, the length of their detention and the content of the case file, the 12th Assize Court of İstanbul refused the applicants’ request on 29 December 2004. The applicants appealed. On 18 January 2005 the 13th Assize Court of İstanbul dismissed their appeal without further reasoning.\n\nOn 1 February 2006 the applicants were released pending trial.\n\nOn 30 April 2008 the 12th Assize Court of İstanbul sentenced the applicants as charged. According to the information in the case file, as submitted by the parties, the proceedings are pending before the Court of Cassation.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 7945/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two [NRP] nationals, Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] (“the applicants”), on [DATE_TIME]. The applicants were detained on remand in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], when they lodged the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the applicants’ complaints concerning the length of their detention and the length of the criminal proceedings brought against them. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On [DATE_TIME] the Government submitted their observations which were sent to Mr. [PERSON], the applicants’ lawyer practicing in [LOCATION], who was requested to submit his replies to the Government’s observations and just satisfaction claims. The Registry did not receive a reply.\n\nBy a letter dated [DATE_TIME], [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION], informed the Court that Mr [PERSON] no longer practised law and he was the new representative. Upon the Registry’s subsequent request, Mr [PERSON] presented a power of attorney in respect of the first applicant. Consequently, on [DATE_TIME], the Registry sent the case file to Mr [PERSON] (by fax and mail) and to the second applicant in [LOCATION], setting a new time limit for their replies to the Government’s observations and just satisfaction claims. The Registry has not received a reply from either the first applicant’s new representative or the second applicant.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicants were arrested and taken into police custody by officers of the [LOCATION] security police in connection with an investigation into an illegal organisation. On [DATE_TIME] the applicants were brought before the [LOCATION] public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively, who remanded the applicants in custody.\n\nBy an indictment dated [DATE_TIME], the public prosecutor at the İstanbul State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants and a number of others, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of taking part in its activities.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the İstanbul State Security Court sentenced the applicants to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and remitted the case. State Security Courts were abolished by constitutional amendments introduced on [DATE_TIME]. Subsequently, the applicants’ case was resumed before the 12th Assize Court of İstanbul.\n\nReferring to recent amendments in domestic law, on [DATE_TIME] the applicants requested to be released pending trial. Relying on the accusations against the applicants, the length of their detention and the content of the case file, the 12th Assize Court of İstanbul refused the applicants’ request on [DATE_TIME]. The applicants appealed. On [DATE_TIME] the 13th Assize Court of İstanbul dismissed their appeal without further reasoning.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicants were released pending trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the 12th Assize Court of İstanbul sentenced the applicants as charged. According to the information in the case file, as submitted by the parties, the proceedings are pending before the Court of Cassation.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36137/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Roman Krosta (“the applicant”), on 27 August 2004.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the proceedings before the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation.\n\nOn 24 January 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1922 and lives in Nowe Brzesko.\n\nIn March 1940 the applicant was deported to Germany where he was subjected to forced labour on three different farms until the end of the Second World War. He worked on the same farm as M.P., his future wife. On 30 April 1945 their daughter was born in Germany. After the end of the war they all returned to Poland. They registered their daughter as having been born in Poland on 13 May 1945, for fear of negative consequences had they revealed that she was born in Germany.\n\nA. Proceedings before the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation concerning the applicant\n\nOn 9 June 2001 the applicant applied to the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation (“the Foundation”) for compensation on account of his forced labour during the war. That request was made under the scheme for slave and forced labourers (“the second compensation scheme”) established under the Joint Statement of 17 July 2000, the German Law of 2 August 2000 on the Creation of the “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” Foundation (“the German Foundation Act”) and the subsequent Agreement of 16 February 2001 between the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation (“the German Foundation”) and the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation.\n\nIt appears that on 1 July 2004 the Foundation’s Verification Commission found that the applicant was eligible for benefits, as his persecution fell under the 4th category, which included persons who had been deported to Germany and subjected to forced labour in agriculture. It consequently awarded him the sum of EUR 1,124.84. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nB. Proceedings before the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation concerning the applicant’s daughter\n\nOn an unspecified date the husband of the applicant’s daughter applied to the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation for compensation on account of her birth at a time when her parents had been forced labourers in Germany. That request was made under the second compensation scheme. On 28 August 2003 the Foundation’s Verification Commission refused the request by the applicant’s daughter. The applicant appealed against that refusal. He relied on a number of statements provided by his fellow forced labourers. On 23 July 2004 the Foundation’s Appeal Commission upheld the refusal. The applicant was informed that during the negotiations in the framework of the so-called “openness clause” it was agreed that children born to parents deported to Germany and subjected to forced labour there were eligible for benefits. However, according to the documents in the file, including his daughter’s identity card, she had been born on 13 May 1945 in Poland. Furthermore, there were no other documents in the file to confirm the applicant’s assertion that his daughter had been born in Germany and had returned with her parents to Poland.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36137/04) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the proceedings before the [NRP]-German Reconciliation Foundation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was deported to [LOCATION] where he was subjected to forced labour on three different farms until the end of the Second World War. He worked on the same farm as M.P., his future wife. On [DATE_TIME] their daughter was born in [LOCATION]. After the end of the war they all returned to [LOCATION]. They registered their daughter as having been born in [LOCATION] on [DATE_TIME], for fear of negative consequences had they revealed that she was born in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Proceedings before the [NRP]-German Reconciliation Foundation concerning the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant applied to the [NRP]-German Reconciliation Foundation (“the Foundation”) for compensation on account of his forced labour during the war. That request was made under the scheme for slave and forced labourers (“the second compensation scheme”) established under the Joint Statement of [DATE_TIME], the German Law of [DATE_TIME] on the Creation of the “Remembrance, Responsibility and Future” Foundation (“the German Foundation Act”) and the subsequent Agreement of [DATE_TIME] between the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation (“the German Foundation”) and the [NRP]-German Reconciliation Foundation.\n\nIt appears that on [DATE_TIME] the Foundation’s Verification Commission found that the applicant was eligible for benefits, as his persecution fell under the 4th category, which included persons who had been deported to [LOCATION] and subjected to forced labour in agriculture. It consequently awarded him the sum of EUR 1,124.84. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nB. Proceedings before the [NRP]-German Reconciliation Foundation concerning the applicant’s daughter\n\nOn an unspecified date the husband of the applicant’s daughter applied to the [NRP]-German Reconciliation Foundation for compensation on account of her birth at a time when her parents had been forced labourers in [LOCATION]. That request was made under the second compensation scheme. On [DATE_TIME] the Foundation’s Verification Commission refused the request by the applicant’s daughter. The applicant appealed against that refusal. He relied on a number of statements provided by his fellow forced labourers. On [DATE_TIME] the Foundation’s Appeal Commission upheld the refusal. The applicant was informed that during the negotiations in the framework of the so-called “openness clause” it was agreed that children born to parents deported to [LOCATION] and subjected to forced labour there were eligible for benefits. However, according to the documents in the file, including his daughter’s identity card, she had been born on [DATE_TIME] in [LOCATION]. Furthermore, there were no other documents in the file to confirm the applicant’s assertion that his daughter had been born in [LOCATION] and had returned with her parents to [LOCATION].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in three applications (nos. 44058/04, 19807/05 and 26384/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Özcan Korkmaz, Mr Serkan Yazar and Mr Murat İslam (“the applicants”), on 1 November 2004, 23 May 2005 and 27 June 2005 respectively. The applicants were represented, respectively, by Ms T. Çelikyürek, Mr C. Calış and Mr A. L. Koçer, lawyers practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 23 September 2008 the Court declared the applications partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the applicants' lack of access to the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence to the Supreme Military Administrative Court (applications nos. 19807/05 and 26384/05) and the non-communication to the applicants of the principal public prosecutor's written opinion (all applications), as well as the submissions of the reporting judge, during the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court (application no. 44058/04). It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were all former members of the Turkish Armed Forces, who had been discharged for disciplinary reasons.\n\nThe applicants brought separate proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, requesting the annulment of their discharge.\n\nThe Supreme Military Administrative Court held, after hearing the parties (except in application no. 44058/04 where no hearing was held) and examining the confidential documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence by virtue of Article 52 (4) of Law no. 1602, that the applicants' discharges had been in conformity with the applicable laws. Consequently, it rejected their annulment requests. Neither the written opinion of the principal public prosecutor submitted to the Supreme Military Administrative Court prior to the hearings, nor the comments of the reporting judge which were entertained during the deliberations, were communicated to the applicants.\n\nThe applicants subsequently requested the rectification of the Supreme Military Administrative Court's decisions. Their requests were rejected on the following days:\n\napplication no. 44058/04: 20 April 2004 (decision served on the applicant on 3 May 2004)\n\napplication no. 19807/05: 26 April 2005\n\napplication no. 26384/05: 2 February 2005",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 33582/08) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Krystyna Seweryn (“the applicant”), on 4 July 2008.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 May 2009 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn 15 January 1999 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a counterclaim for payment against the “Adwokat” Housing Co-operative (Spółdzielnia Mieszkaniowa “Adwokat”). The proceedings for payment instituted by the housing co-operative had been pending since 10 October 1997.\n\nOn 2 February 1999 the applicant lodged a motion for joinder of the cases.\n\nOn 17 June 1999 the court held a hearing; however it did not give any decision on the applicant's motion.\n\nAfter three years and ten months, on 20 October 2002, the court gave a decision that the case should be examined separately in another set of proceedings and returned the statement of claim to the applicant because of procedural shortcomings. The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal.\n\nOn 30 January 2003 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.\n\nOn an unspecified date the Warsaw District Court again returned the statement of claim to the applicant because of procedural shortcomings. The applicant lodged another interlocutory appeal.\n\nOn 15 November 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the contested decision and remitted the case.\n\nHearings scheduled for 25 January and 6 March 2008 were adjourned as another case had been given priority.\n\nOn 12 May 2008 the Warsaw District Court gave a default judgment.\n\nOn 9 June 2008 the court supplemented the judgment by ordering its immediate enforceability.\n\nOn 30 June 2008 the defendant filed an objection (sprzeciw) against the default judgment.\n\nOn 8 July 2008 the Warsaw District Court quashed the order of immediate enforceability.\n\nOn 19 August, 30 September, 18 November, 16 December 2008 the Warsaw District Court held hearings. Hearings scheduled for 19 February and 2 April 2009 were adjourned due to the absence of one of the witnesses. On 26 June and 17 November 2009 the court held hearings.\n\nThe case is still pending before the first-instance court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 20 March 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nThe applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Warsaw District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn 25 April 2008 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the complaint. The court did not analyse the conduct of the trial court. It limited its consideration to the applicant's conduct, namely to the fact that she had made use of her procedural rights, which, in the court's view, had led to delays in the proceedings.",

It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged with the Warsaw District Court ([PERSON]) a counterclaim for payment against the “Adwokat” Housing Co-operative ([PERSON] “Adwokat”). The proceedings for payment instituted by the housing co-operative had been pending since [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a motion for joinder of the cases.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court held a hearing; however it did not give any decision on the applicant's motion.\n\nAfter [DATE_TIME], on [DATE_TIME], the court gave a decision that the case should be examined separately in another set of proceedings and returned the statement of claim to the applicant because of procedural shortcomings. The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case.\n\nOn an unspecified date the Warsaw District Court again returned the statement of claim to the applicant because of procedural shortcomings. The applicant lodged another interlocutory appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the contested decision and remitted the case.\n\nHearings scheduled for [DATE_TIME] were adjourned as another case had been given priority.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw District Court gave a default judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court supplemented the judgment by ordering its immediate enforceability.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the defendant filed an objection (sprzeciw) against the default judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw District Court quashed the order of immediate enforceability.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw District Court held hearings. Hearings scheduled for [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] were adjourned due to the absence of one of the witnesses. On [DATE_TIME] the court held hearings.\n\nThe case is still pending before the first-instance court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nThe applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Warsaw District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the complaint. The court did not analyse the conduct of the trial court.

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 32981/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Atalay Dede, Mr Mehmet Kumral, Mr Hüseyin Hakkı Zabcı and Mehmet Akın Dirik (“the applicants”), on 30 May, 14 and 18 June 1996 respectively.\n\nMr Dede and Mr Dirik were represented before the Court by Mrs Nurten Çaglar and Mr Mehdi Bektaş respectively, lawyers practising in Ankara. Mr Kumral and Mr Zabcı did not designate a lawyer for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador Tugay Uluçevik.\n\nThe applicants complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the proceedings against them.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Artice 27 § of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 17 October 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) . This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicants\n\nIn January and February 1981 the applicants were arrested by policemen and placed in police custody. They were accused of membership of an illegal organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).\n\nOn 15 April, 11 May and 9 July 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court (sıkıyönetim mahkemesi) ordered the applicants’ detention on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court\n\nOn 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Ankara Martial Law Court setting out charges against 723 defendants, including the applicants. He accused the applicants of membership of an organisation whose aim was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime, contrary to Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code\n\nOn different dates the applicants were all released pending trial by the Ankara Martial Law Court.\n\nAfter martial Law was lifted, the Ankara Martial Law Court took the name of Martial Law Court attached to the 4th Army Corps.\n\nOn 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicants and sentenced them to terms of imprisonment. The applicants appealed to the Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yargıtay).\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 26 December 1994, which abolished the jurisdiction of the martial law courts, the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the cases and the files were sent to it.\n\nOn 28 December 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld Mr Mehmet Kumral’s and Mr Hüseyin Hakkı Zabcı’s conviction. It quashed the convictions of Mr Dede and Mr Dirik and referred the cases to the Ankara Assize Court (ağır ceza mahkemesi). The criminal proceedings are still pending before the latter court.",

Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Ankara Martial Law Court setting out charges against 723 defendants, including the applicants. He accused the applicants of membership of an organisation whose aim was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a [NRP]-Leninist regime, contrary to Article 146 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code\n\nOn different dates the applicants were all released pending trial by the Ankara Martial Law Court.\n\nAfter martial [PERSON] was lifted, the Ankara Martial Law Court took the name of Martial Law Court attached to the 4th Army Corps.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Martial Law Court convicted the applicants and sentenced them to terms of imprisonment. The applicants appealed to the Military Court of Cassation ([PERSON]).\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of [DATE_TIME], which abolished the jurisdiction of the martial law courts, the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the cases and the files were sent to it.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld Mr [PERSON]’s and Mr [PERSON]’s conviction. It quashed the convictions of Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] and referred the cases to the Ankara Assize Court (ağır ceza mahkemesi). The criminal proceedings are still pending before the latter court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 2983/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Bogdan Dzierżanowski (“the applicant”), on 19 December 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nOn 24 August 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Białystok, Poland.\n\nOn 22 December 1992 the applicant was involved in a car accident as a result of which one person died. Subsequently, the prosecution service opened an investigation in the case.\n\nOn 31 March 1993 the prosecution service discontinued the investigation. Subsequently, an auxiliary prosecutor appealed and the investigation was resumed.\n\nOn 25 June 1993 the applicant was charged with manslaughter. It appears that the applicant had by then left the country and was not notified of the decision.\n\nOn 30 June 1993 the applicant was indicted before the Białystok District Court.\n\nOn 11 February 1994 the trial court decided to stay the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant’s address could not be established as he had left the country.\n\nOn 29 March 1996 the District Court issued an arrest warrant against the applicant. On 2 July 1996 the applicant was arrested by the police while crossing the Polish border.\n\nOn 8 August 1996 the trial court resumed the proceedings and held a hearing. Subsequently, the District Court held hearings on 19 September and 10 December 1996 and 11 February and 25 June 1997.\n\nIn 1998 the court held hearings on 18 February, 19 April, 1 September and 8 October.\n\nOn 12 October 1998 the Białystok District Court gave judgment. The trial court acquitted the applicant.\n\nOn 16 February 1999 the Białystok Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) examined the appeal lodged by the auxiliary prosecutor. The appellate court quashed the judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 26 November 1999 the Białystok District Court held a hearing. In 2000 the trial court held one hearing on 28 January and ordered that an expert opinion be prepared.\n\nOn 10 May 2001 the next hearing was held. At the hearing on 8 June 2001 the applicant pleaded guilty. On the same day the Białystok District Court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence. The judgment is final.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 653/12) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Karykowski (“the applicant”), on 27 December 2011.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr T. Bąk, a lawyer practising in Szczecin. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged a breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition on him of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime.\n\nOn 7 July 2014 the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and is detained in Stargard Szczeciński.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nThe applicant is a habitual offender. He was arrested on an unspecified date on suspicion of uttering threats. He was subsequently convicted as charged and sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment. He was first detained in Nowogard Prison and subsequently in Goleniów Prison.\n\nB. Imposition of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn 7 September 2011 the applicant’s cell was searched. During the search the prison officers found a note entitled “Protest letter” signed by 135 prisoners. The prisoners stated their opposition to the forthcoming changes to the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences affecting, in particular, the possibility of shopping during prison visits. The letter was confiscated by the authorities.\n\nOn 8 September 2011 the Nowogard Prison Penitentiary Commission imposed on the applicant the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime. The commission held that the applicant was one of the organisers of a planned collective remonstrance in Nowogard Prison, and that it was therefore necessary to isolate him from other prisoners.\n\nThe applicant appealed against that decision. He submitted that he was not the organiser of the protest but merely one of 140 prisoners who had signed the letter.\n\nOn 29 November 2011 the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The court held that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn an unknown date the applicant was transferred to Goleniów Prison.\n\nOn 6 December 2011 the Goleniów Prison Penitentiary Commission extended the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime, holding that the applicant represented a serious threat to the community and should be kept in a solitary cell. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 31 January 2012 the Szczecin Regional Court quashed the decision and remitted the case to the commission. The court held that only the original decision to impose the regime of 8 September 2011 had been justified. The following one taken on 6 December 2011 had not indicated any new circumstances justifying the continuing application of the regime and its reasoning had been scarce. The court noted that several months had elapsed since the applicant had signed the protest letter and the suppositions regarding the allegedly planned collective remonstrance of the prisoners had been not confirmed.\n\nOn 14 February 2012 the Goleniów Prison Penitentiary Commission decided to lift the “dangerous detainee” regime. The regime was imposed on the applicant for a total of five months and seven days.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 653/12) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [PERSON]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON], of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged a breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition on him of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and is detained in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nThe applicant is a habitual offender. He was arrested on an unspecified date on suspicion of uttering threats. He was subsequently convicted as charged and sentenced to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. He was first detained in [LOCATION] and subsequently in [LOCATION].\n\nB. Imposition of the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s cell was searched. During the search the prison officers found a note entitled “Protest letter” signed by 135 prisoners. The prisoners stated their opposition to the forthcoming changes to the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences affecting, in particular, the possibility of shopping during prison visits. The letter was confiscated by the authorities.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Nowogard Prison Penitentiary Commission imposed on the applicant the so-called “dangerous detainee” regime. The commission held that the applicant was one of the organisers of a planned collective remonstrance in [LOCATION], and that it was therefore necessary to isolate him from other prisoners.\n\nThe applicant appealed against that decision. He submitted that he was not the organiser of the protest but merely one of 140 prisoners who had signed the letter.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The court held that the decision had been lawful.\n\nOn an unknown date the applicant was transferred to [PERSON].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Goleniów Prison Penitentiary Commission extended the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime, holding that the applicant represented a serious threat to the community and should be kept in a solitary cell. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Szczecin Regional Court quashed the decision and remitted the case to the commission. The court held that only the original decision to impose the regime of [DATE_TIME] had been justified. The following one taken on [DATE_TIME] had not indicated any new circumstances justifying the continuing application of the regime and its reasoning had been scarce. The court noted that [DATE_TIME] had elapsed since the applicant had signed the protest letter and the suppositions regarding the allegedly planned collective remonstrance of the prisoners had been not confirmed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Goleniów Prison Penitentiary Commission decided to lift the “dangerous detainee” regime. The regime was imposed on the applicant for a total of [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 45712/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Adem Dost, Mr Şeker Dost and Mr Osman Cinel (“the applicants”) on 12 November 1998.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr İbrahim Gemici, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 17 June 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. In a letter of 22 June 2004, the Court informed the parties that in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1956, 1954 and 1955 respectively and live in Munich, Germany.\n\nIn 1995 the Sakarya Governor’s office expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicants. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and the relevant amount was paid to them when the expropriation took place.\n\nFollowing the applicants’ request for increased compensation, on 11 September 1997 the Sakarya Civil Court of First-instance awarded them an additional compensation of 865,267,950 Turkish liras (TRL)1 plus interest at the statutory rate running from 12 December 1995, the date on which the title-deed to the land had been transferred to the Sakarya Governor’s Office. In the course of the proceedings, the court conducted on-site visits and requested three expert reports which concluded that the land in question was development land (arsa). In view of a judgment rendered by the Joint Civil Chambers of the Court of Cassation which ruled that the lands within the vicinity of the Sakarya organised industrial zone should be considered as agricultural lands, the court decided that it would not take the three expert reports into account. It therefore relied on a fourth expert report which served as a conciliation report for a calculation of the amount due to the applicants.\n\nThe applicants appealed against the judgment of the Sakarya Civil Court of First-instance. In their submissions, the applicants contested the court’s decision to take solely the last expert report into consideration.\n\nOn 12 February 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Sakarya Civil Court of First-instance.\n\nOn 1 April 1998 the Sakarya Governor’s Office paid the amount of TRL 1,513,641,0332 to the applicants.\n\nOn 26 May 1998 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicants’ request for rectification.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 58058/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Turkish nationals, Mr Yahya Kezer, Mr Nedim Öndeş, Mr Arap Doğan, Mr Ferhan Özçelik and Mr Selhan Tekin (“the applicants”), on 11 April 2000.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr M. İşeri, a lawyer practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 5 October 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the applicants’ right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI.

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 23789/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Katarzyna Gnatowska (“the applicant”), on 18 June 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms M. Gąsiorowska, a lawyer practising in Warszawa. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 13 September 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Zakroczym.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn 4 March 1986 the applicant’s mother lodged with the Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a motion for the dissolution of a co-ownership and division of an inheritance. The estate comprised, inter alia, a farm and plots of land located in Zakroczym. The applicant and her brother were also involved in the proceedings as parties.\n\nBetween 4 March 1986 and 3 April 1992 the court scheduled fifteen hearings and appointed three experts. In the meantime, the applicant lodged several complaints about the unreasonable length of the proceedings, to no avail.\n\nOn 3 April 1992 the court stayed the proceedings. They were resumed on 24 July 1995.\n\nBetween 16 August 1995 and 14 May 2002 the court scheduled twenty-three hearings, thirteen of which were adjourned for various reasons, for instance the need to obtain additional evidence, in particular several experts’ reports. Three hearings were adjourned at the applicant’s request.\n\nOn 14 May 2002 the court closed the trial and adjourned delivery of a decision. On 28 May 2002 the same court re-opened the proceedings and ordered that additional evidence be obtained, including experts’ reports.\n\nOn 17 November 2002 the applicant’s brother died and the proceedings were stayed. They were resumed on an unspecified date in 2003.\n\nBetween 20 February 2003 and 1 June 2007 the court ordered four expert reports to be obtained and scheduled sixteen hearings, five of which were adjourned.\n\nThe proceedings are pending before the first-instance court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 5 September 2005 the applicant lodged with the Warszawa Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nThe applicant sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approx. EUR 2,500).\n\nOn 7 October 2005 the Warszawa Regional Court dismissed her complaint on the ground that on the date of the entry into force of the 2004 Act no undue delays in the proceedings could be discerned. Although the court acknowledged in general that the proceedings before 2004 had been unreasonably lengthy, it did not examine the course of the proceedings prior to the date of the entry into force of the 2004 Act. It stressed that the provisions of the 2004 Act could be applied only to proceedings pending after 17 September 2004.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 34656/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Cüneyt Mehmet Barker (“the applicant”), on 9 July 2003. The applicant was represented by Mr K. Koç, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 16 October 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 15 August 1988 the applicant brought a case before the Erdek Civil Court against the Treasury, requesting to be registered as the owner of a certain plot of land.\n\nOn 17 April 1990 the Erdek Civil Court granted the applicant’s request. The Treasury appealed.\n\nWhenever he inquired about the outcome of the appeal proceedings, the applicant was informed by the registry of the first-instance court that the proceedings were still pending. In 1998, however, the applicant was informed by the Court of Cassation that the latter had actually rendered its decision long before, on 28 October 1992. The Erdek Civil Court declared, in response to a petition from the applicant, that the case file had never been sent back to it and it had subsequently attempted to recreate the case file, which appeared to have been lost.\n\nOn 8 May 1998 the Treasury filed a petition with the Court of Cassation requesting that the decision of 28 October 1992 be rectified.\n\nOn 28 September 1998 the Court of Cassation decided that it could not examine the Treasury’s request as the reconstituted file was not sufficient and it needed the original case file for such an examination. It therefore decided to send the file back to the Erdek Civil Court. According to the information submitted by the parties to the Court, the proceedings are still pending.\n\nIn 2001 the Land Registry Commission attached to the General Directorate of Land Registration conducted a land registry survey and registered the title to the relevant plot under the name of a certain K.T. and the Treasury.\n\nOn 30 May 2001 the applicant brought a case before the Erdek Cadastral Court, challenging the land registry survey.\n\nOn 18 May 2004 an on-site inspection of the land was carried out, and on 20 October 2004 the Erdek Cadastral Court allowed the applicant’s request in part.\n\nOn 10 November 2005 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 20 October 2004 and on 26 February 2007 it dismissed the Treasury’s rectification request.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 22072/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Sławomir Małasiewicz (“the applicant”), on 25 May 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 17 December 2002 the Fourth Section declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Częstochowa, Poland.\n\nIn June 1995, on his way to work, the applicant bought a bottle of sparkling mineral water. While he was opening it, the bottle exploded and its metal cap hit the applicant’s left eye. The accident, despite the subsequent surgeries and medical treatment, resulted in the applicant’s loss of vision in his left eye. He was declared an invalid and was granted a disability pension by the Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych).\n\nIn August 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings for compensation and pension against the producer of the mineral water. He submitted medical certificates issued by the Częstochowa and Katowice Hospitals which treated his injury.\n\nOn 23 October 1997 the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki w Częstochowie) exempted the applicant from the court fees.\n\nOn 15 November and 15 December 1997 the trial court held hearings.\n\nIn December 1997 the “S” assurance company joined the proceedings as an intervener.\n\nIn 1998 the trial court held four hearings at which it heard witnesses.\n\nOn 8 December 1998 the court, sitting in camera, ordered a medical expert opinion.\n\nOn 18 May 1999 the court received the opinion.\n\nOn 25 May 1999 the court, sitting in camera, ordered the Social Security Board to provide a copy of the applicant’s file.\n\nBetween 24 November 1998 and 7 September 1999 no hearings were held.\n\nAt the subsequent hearings held on 8 September 1999, 12 January and 14 June 2000 the court heard witnesses and ordered the preparation of new expert opinions.\n\nOn 13 December 2000 the trial court held a hearing at which it asked for another expert medical opinion to be prepared.\n\nOn 10 April 2001 the court received the expert opinion. The intervener challenged it.\n\nAt the hearing held on 20 June 2001 the court requested an expert opinion concerning the applicant’s pension.\n\nThe expert submitted the opinion on 31 January 2002. Again, the intervener challenged the opinion.\n\nThe next hearing, which was held on 20 March 2002, was adjourned sine die. The court ordered another expert opinion.\n\nOn 24 May 2002 the opinion was submitted to the court. Subsequently, the intervener challenged it.\n\nOn 27 September 2002 the trial court held a hearing.\n\nOn 30 September 2002 the Częstochowa Regional Court gave judgment. The defendant was found liable for the damage sustained by the applicant. The court awarded the applicant PLN 85,000 in compensation but dismissed his claim for pension.\n\nBoth parties appealed against this judgment.\n\nOn 4 April 2003 the applicant was exempted from the court-fees in the appeal procedure. The proceedings are pending before the Court of Appeal.",

Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME], on his way to work, the applicant bought a bottle of sparkling mineral water. While he was opening it, the bottle exploded and its metal cap hit the applicant’s left eye. The accident, despite the subsequent surgeries and medical treatment, resulted in the applicant’s loss of vision in his left eye. He was declared an invalid and was granted a disability pension by the Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych).\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the applicant instituted civil proceedings for compensation and pension against the producer of the mineral water. He submitted medical certificates issued by the [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] which treated his injury.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki w Częstochowie) exempted the applicant from the court fees.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court held hearings.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the “S” assurance company joined the proceedings as an intervener.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the trial court held four hearings at which it heard witnesses.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court, sitting in camera, ordered a medical expert opinion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court received the opinion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court, sitting in camera, ordered the Social Security Board to provide a copy of the applicant’s file.\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] no hearings were held.\n\nAt the subsequent hearings held on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the court heard witnesses and ordered the preparation of new expert opinions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court held a hearing at which it asked for another expert medical opinion to be prepared.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court received the expert opinion. The intervener challenged it.\n\nAt the hearing held on [DATE_TIME] the court requested an expert opinion concerning the applicant’s pension.\n\nThe expert submitted the opinion on [DATE_TIME]. Again, the intervener challenged the opinion.\n\nThe next hearing, which was held on [DATE_TIME], was adjourned sine die. The court ordered another expert opinion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the opinion was submitted to the court. Subsequently, the intervener challenged it.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court held a hearing.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Częstochowa Regional Court gave judgment. The defendant was found liable for the damage sustained by the applicant. The court awarded the applicant PLN 85,000 in compensation but dismissed his claim for pension.\n\nBoth parties appealed against this judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was exempted from the court-fees in the appeal procedure. The proceedings are pending before the Court of Appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 30072/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Stefan Kozłowski (“the applicant”), on 11 July 2004.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 December 2006 the President of the Fourth Section, to which the case had been allocated, decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Szczecin.\n\nA. First set of criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1993 two sets of criminal proceedings against the applicant were instituted before the Szczecin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). The applicant was charged with armed robbery. On 10 May 1994 the respective proceedings were joined.\n\nOn 26 October 1999 the Szczecin District Court gave judgment and convicted the applicant.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal.\n\nOn 16 February 2000 the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) remitted the case.\n\nAccording to the applicant’s submissions, the court refused to send him copies of the relevant documents concerning the impugned proceedings. Because of this, he could not submit detailed information about the dates of hearings and the reasons for their adjournment.\n\nOn 28 February 2005 the Szczecin District Court again gave judgment and sentenced the applicant to three years and six months’ imprisonment.\n\nAccording to the Government’s submissions, the first-instance judgment was upheld by the Regional Court on appeal and the proceedings terminated in July 2005.\n\nB. Second set of criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant was charged with acting as part of an organised criminal group. The applicant has failed to produce any documents concerning this set of proceedings; he only stated that he had been convicted by a judgment of the Kraków Court of Appeal on 4 April 1996.\n\nC. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). He sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings in his case had been excessive and requesting an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN - approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn 13 January 2005 the Szczecin Regional Court gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings, finding that there had been some periods of unjustified inactivity (lasting from several months to some three years) on the part of the Szczecin District Court. It awarded the applicant PLN 5,000 (approx. EUR 1,222) in just satisfaction. Referring to the amount of just satisfaction, the court relied on the fact that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings because he “had lodged numerous letters with the court” and “because of his state of health a number of hearings had to be adjourned”.",

On 8 December 2007 the Żary District Court ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 22 December 2007 he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was discharged from the hospital on 2 January 2008.\n\nOn 9 April 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and discontinued the proceedings against the applicant. The court found it established that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. However, he could not have been held criminally responsible as he had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It further referred to the experts' opinion and ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn the same date the court also refused the applicant's motion for release. The court considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant might commit another crime.\n\nOn 23 April 2008 the Żary District Court extended the applicant's detention until 22 September 2008. The court referred to the reasons given previously. In addition, it relied on the risk that the applicant might commit yet another offence. It stressed that it was necessary to keep the applicant in detention until his admission to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe applicant was transferred between different detention centres. After 28 March 2008 he was detained in the Nowa Sól Detention Centre.\n\nOn 21 May 2008 the Żary District Court was informed that the applicant had appealed against the decision of 9 April 2008. However he had filed his appeal with the Supreme Court instead of with the Regional Court. Therefore, the Supreme Court asked the lower court to examine whether the applicant's motion could be regarded as an appeal against the decision of 9 April 2008.\n\nOn 2 July 2008 the Zielona Góra Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the decision of 9 April 2008. The court held that all the conditions for imposing the preventive measure on the applicant had been met.\n\nOn 7 July 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and ordered that the applicant be placed in the Lubiąż Psychiatric Hospital. It was also established that the applicant could be admitted to this facility on 8 August 2008. However, the applicant subsequently appealed against this decision in so far as it related to the choice of hospital and the case file was transferred to the Zielona Góra Regional Court. On 29 August 2008 the Zielona Góra Regional Court upheld the decision of 7 July 2008.\n\nThe applicant was admitted to the hospital on 15 September 2008.\n\nIt appears that he left the hospital on a later unknown date before February 2009.",

The applicants were represented by Ms A. Bıçak and Mr K. Berzeg, lawyers practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 7 October 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Ankara. The second applicant is a construction company registered in Turkey.\n\nOn 10 October 1990 the applicant company brought a civil action before the Seventh Chamber of the Ankara Civil Court against the National Water Board (Devlet Su İşleri) to recover the monies owed to it under a construction contract (case no. 1990/584).\n\nOn 27 December 1993 the Ankara Civil Court awarded the applicant company's claim in full, plus interest.\n\nOn 18 November 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural and substantive grounds.\n\nOn 16 March 1995 the applicant company brought an additional action against the National Water Board before the Eighth Chamber of the Ankara Civil Court in relation to the latter's default in certain other financial undertakings under the aforementioned construction contract (case no. 1995/255).\n\nOn 28 September 1995 the Eighth Chamber of the Ankara Civil Court decided to join case no. 1995/255 with case no. 1990/584 pending before the Seventh Chamber of the Ankara Civil Court.\n\nOn 15 December 1998, 12 September 2000 and 5 July 2001 the Ankara Civil Court rendered three separate judgments on the case, all of which were quashed by the Court of Cassation on 20 May 1999, 6 February 2001 and 27 December 2001 respectively on procedural and substantive grounds, including erroneous calculations, resulting in the remittal of the case to the Ankara Civil Court each time.\n\nOn 19 April 2002 the Ankara Civil Court examined the case for the fifth time and awarded the applicant company's claim in part, together with interest.\n\nOn 6 June 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court with certain minor technical amendments.",

N. Yılmaz and Mr A. Yılmaz, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 4 June 2012 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1981 and, according to the latest information available to the Court, lives in Aksaray.\n\nOn 2 April 2011 the applicant, who had been living in Turkey since 2008, was taken into custody in the context of an investigation into murder by a person or persons unknown. He was placed in the Yedikule Security Directorate in Istanbul.\n\nOn 4 April 2011 the applicant delivered his witness statement before a criminal court in relation to the aforementioned investigation. However, he was not released after delivering the statement; instead he continued to be detained in the Yedikule Security Directorate for having outstayed his visa.\n\nOn 5 April 2011 the applicant was transferred to Şehit Tevfik Fikret Erciyes police station in Fatih, Istanbul (“Fatih police station”), where he was placed in a custodial cell for the next five days.\n\nOn 10 April 2011 the applicant was sent to Kumkapı Removal Centre with a view to being deported. According to the applicant’s account, Kumkapı Removal Centre was severely overcrowded at the time of his detention. He had to share a dormitory measuring approximately 30‑35 sq. m with twenty-four to forty-five other people and the overcrowding of the centre resulted in hygiene problems. The building was infested with insects and the quality and quantity of the food provided was also fairly poor. Moreover, there was no provision for outdoor exercise.\n\nOn 12 April 2011 the applicant lodged an application with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for refugee status.\n\nOn 27 April 2011 he claimed asylum from the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nOn 29 April 2011 the applicant was granted a temporary residence permit in the province of Aksaray as an asylum seeker and he was released from Kumkapı Removal Centre on the same day. It appears that the applicant was subsequently permitted to reside in Konya.\n\nAccording to the latest information provided to the Court, the applicant’s applications for asylum and refugee status are still pending before the domestic authorities and the UNHCR respectively.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 25088/07) against the Swiss Confederation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Montenegrin national, Mr Srdan Pesukic (“the applicant”), on 12 June 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr T. Reich, a lawyer practising in Zurich. The Swiss Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr F. Schürmann, of the Federal Office of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his criminal conviction was based to a decisive extent on testimony given by an anonymous witness.\n\nOn 26 November 2009 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nHaving been informed on 4 December 2009 of their right to submit written observations, the Government of Montenegro did not express an intention to take part in the proceedings.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974. He is currently detained in a cantonal prison in Regensdorf in Switzerland.\n\nOn 15 October 2001, shortly after midnight, N.B. was killed by a gunshot in the back of his neck in front of the post-office in Zurich‑Schwamendingen. The applicant was suspected of having carried out the shooting.\n\nOn 8 July and 21 August 2002, the prosecution authority of the canton of Zurich interrogated X as a witness. X declared that he had been at the crime scene and that he had been able to see, from a distance of twenty metres, that the applicant had shot the victim in the back of his neck. During the interrogations, the witness, the investigating judge, a police officer and a translator were sitting in a separate room, while the applicant, the former co‑accused Z. L., their respective defence counsel and two police guards were sitting in another room. The interrogation was transmitted via a sound link, and the witness’ voice was distorted in order to protect the witness’ anonymity. Following the interrogation, the defence counsel were given the opportunity to put additional questions via the sound link.\n\nAt the beginning of each interrogation the applicant’s counsel declared that the modalities of the witness interrogations did not allow for an adequate exercise of the rights of the defence.\n\nOn 29 January 2004, X was interrogated before the Jury Court of the canton of Zurich (Geschworenengericht). While the judges, the jury and an interpreter were sitting directly together with the witness in the hearing room, the applicant, his counsel, the interpreter, the civil parties, the public prosecutor and the journalists were placed in one of the court’s deliberation rooms. The interrogation was transmitted via a sound link and the witness’ voice was distorted in order to prevent his being identified.\n\nThe applicant and his counsel were allowed to put additional questions to X. The latter, however, refused to answer a number of questions which the defence counsel considered to be important, notably the following: “Why had X arranged a meeting with N.B.? How did X react after the crime? Did X approach the body? Did he wait for the police? Did he consume drugs? Was he afraid of someone close to the applicant? Had he been concretely threatened by someone? Did X have an argument with the applicant or with Z.L.? Where did X go after the crime? Was he on foot or did he have a vehicle? Did he have a criminal record? Was he residing legally in Switzerland? Did he wear spectacles?”\n\nOn 6 February 2004, the jury court convicted the applicant of manslaughter (vorsätzliche Tötung) and of several counts of drug-trafficking and sentenced him to fourteen years and nine months’ detention. The court considered that the testimony given by X was credible and pertinent. It further considered that the conditions to allow the witness’ anonymity were met. It noted that X had submitted in a credible and convincing way that his life was in danger in case he testified, as persons close to the applicant and to Z. L. were ready to take revenge and did not even hesitate to kill somebody. According to X’s submissions, he was the only person who had observed the crime and who dared to testify. It thus appeared comprehensible that X feared reprisals. It was further obvious that the applicant had a motive to take revenge on the witness who had contributed to his conviction and to prevent him from making further testimonies.\n\nThe fears expressed by X were in line with the overall picture conveyed by the other witnesses, who showed fear which was sometimes even bordering to panic when it came to making any concrete incriminating statements. The court considered that there were concrete indications that the applicant lived in an extremely violent environment in which recourse to violence and even to arms was frequent even for seemingly minor reasons. Moreover, there were specific indications that persons who had been ready to testify before the jury court had been exposed to death threats.\n\nThe court further considered that the measures taken were both necessary and sufficient to prevent identification of the witness X. The court had taken a number of measures to compensate the restrictions imposed on the rights of the defence. Firstly, the witness had not been examined by the regional prosecutor (Bezirksanwalt), but by the president of the court. Secondly, the identity of X had been confirmed by the police-officer in charge of the investigation and had been known to the regional prosecutor and to the president of the court.\n\nThirdly, the police officer and the regional prosecutor gave testimony about X’s reputation and credibility. It had thus been known that X had no criminal record and that there was no indication that he had any contact with the drug trafficking scene. There was further no indication that X had been in any way involved in the crime. It was further known that X spoke the Serbo-Croatian language. Conversely, the regional prosecutor refused to divulge any detailed information on X’s private and professional background, his education, his family situation and his residence status. The jury court considered, however, that this information was of minor importance for the assessment of credibility and that the information available gave the court a sound basis for assessing the general credibility of the witness.\n\nThe court further noted that X had been interrogated in front of the complete court and that all persons participating in the decision-making process could gain a personal impression of the witness and of his reaction to the questions put to him. Furthermore, the court had taken into account that, under the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, a conviction could not be exclusively based on testimony given by an anonymous witness. The principle of a public hearing had been safeguarded by allowing the press directly to follow the interrogation from the separate room in which the defence was seated. The court considered that the core rights of the defence had been safeguarded and that the measures taken had been proportionate.\n\nReferring to the Court’s case-law, the jury court considered that a criminal conviction must not be exclusively based on testimony given by an anonymous witness. Accordingly, the court considered that it could not rely on the anonymous witness’ testimony insofar as this constituted the only evidence available. The jury court resumed its examination by laying out general principles for the assessment of the credibility of evidence by witnesses. It considered that the applicant’s own submissions, according to which he could not have been present at the crime scene as he first entered Swiss territory in January 2002 – and thus after the victim had been killed – were contradictory and thus lacked credibility. Conversely, the court considered the testimony given by the anonymous witness, who submitted that he had seen the applicant shooting the victim, to be credible.\n\nThe jury court further considered that there had been other evidence linking the applicant to the crime. There was, in particular, witness and circumstantial evidence allowing the conclusion that the applicant had been residing in the Zurich region since August 2001, that he had known the victim and that he had engaged in drug trafficking with him. As regarded the shooting of the victim, the court considered that the statements made by the witness Z. L., who had declared in a credible and convincing way to the police that the applicant had explained to him some days after the incident that he had killed N.B. before the latter could kill him, weighed heavily against the applicant, notwithstanding the fact that Z. L. did not repeat these allegations during the court proceedings, but stated that he could not remember what had happened. The testimony given by Z. L. during the police investigation was supported by the convincing submissions made by the anonymous witness, and by testimony given by a witness who had presumably met the applicant immediately after the crime. Relying on all available evidence, the jury court concluded that there was no doubt that N. B. had been shot by the applicant. With regard to the concrete factual circumstances, the jury court considered that the prosecution based its submissions mainly on testimony given by the anonymous witness. It followed that, for formal reasons, these circumstances could not be taken into account and that it had to be assumed in the applicant’s favour that the concrete circumstances had not been proven. It followed that there was no sufficient factual basis which would allow the conclusion that the applicant acted with a particular degree of scrupulousness (besonders skrupellos) which would lead to the crime being characterised as murder.\n\nThe applicant lodged a nullity appeal (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde) with the Court of Cassation (Kassationsgericht) of the canton of Zurich.\n\nBy decision of 19 December 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the lower court. That court noted that the anonymous witness had been heard in camera and that the applicant’s counsel did not have the possibility directly to question the witness. Neither the applicant nor his counsel had ever seen the witness, whose personal details remained secret. The court further noted that the witness refused to answer a number of questions which the defence considered important (see paragraph 11, above). The court did not call into question that the legal conditions for granting anonymity were fulfilled in the instant case and confirmed the first instance court’s finding that it had been necessary to protect X against possible reprisals.\n\nWith regard to the applicant’s rights under Article 6 of the Convention, the court considered that the maintenance of the anonymity of the witness X and the fact that X had been shielded from sight and that his voice had been distorted seriously interfered with the defence’s right to confront the witness. The fact that the prosecution and the presiding judge were aware of the witness’ identity could not be regarded as a counterbalancing factor as such. Given the fact that all judges were accountable for the judgment, and that it was the role of the defence to examine the findings of the prosecution from the defendant’s point of view, it appeared problematic that the presiding judge had knowledge that was superior to that of the other members of the court, including the jury, and that the latter had more knowledge than the defence. Adequate compensation could only be conceivable if at least the defence had the right directly to take part in the interrogation of the witness and was given the opportunity to assess the witness’ credibility; however, this possibility was not granted in the instant case.\n\nRelying on the Court’s case-law (the court referred to the cases of Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑II and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997‑III), the court considered that the criminal court could not rely on the testimony given by the anonymous witness for two separate reasons: Firstly, according to the case-law of the Court, it was decisive whether the applicant’s defence counsel had been present during the interrogation of the anonymous witness or had at least been in a position to follow the interrogation via an audio‑visual link and to put questions. As this had not been the case, the modalities of the witness’ interrogation did not comply with the standards set up by the Court and were thus contrary to Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n\nSecondly, the court examined whether the testimony given by the anonymous witness had to be regarded as being “decisive” for the applicant’s conviction within the meaning of the “sole or decisive” rule developed by the Court. It noted that the anonymous witness was the only direct witness of the crime at issue, as the remaining witnesses only gave evidence by hearsay. It was thus obvious that the anonymous witness’ testimony had more than only minor relevance for the assessment of the evidence. Even though the evidence given by other – indirect – witnesses carried a certain weight, the anonymous witness had to be regarded as the decisive evidence (“massgebliches Beweismittel”), and was decisive to an extent which, under the Court’s case-law, excluded the possibility of having recourse to this evidence in order to establish the applicant’s guilt.\n\nOn 3 February 2006 the senior public prosecutor (Oberstaatsanwalt) of the canton of Zurich lodged a nullity appeal against the decision of the Court of Cassation.\n\nBy judgment of 2 November 2006 the Federal Tribunal (Kassationshof) quashed the decision of 19 December 2005 and remitted the case to the Court of Cassation. That court considered that the lower court’s judgment did not comply with the principle of free appreciation of the evidence under Article 249 of the Federal Law on Criminal Procedure (Grundsatz der freien Beweiswürdigung, see relevant domestic law, below).\n\nThe Federal Tribunal confirmed that it had been necessary to protect the witness by shielding his appearance both from the applicant and from the applicant’s counsel. It considered that the counsel was not under any legal obligation to transmit information on the witness’ identity to the applicant. Even if such a duty existed, the risk that the defence counsel did not respect this obligation or inadvertently divulged information to his client was unacceptably high. The tribunal further considered that it was compatible with Article 6 of the Convention to consider the testimony given by an anonymous witness insofar as it could complete – like a mosaic stone – the picture gained through other evidence, which was in itself not sufficient to support an establishment of guilt, but established a strong suspicion, and thus contributed to a full establishment of guilt.\n\nThe tribunal further reviewed the other evidence examined by the jury court and concluded that this evidence, taken separately, would have been sufficient “to establish a strong suspicion of a criminal offence, or even to establish his guilt”. The tribunal reiterated that the jury court had considered that the testimony given by the witness X had been credible and that it was, furthermore, in line with the scientific conclusion that the victim had been killed by gunshot in the back of his neck on 15 October 2001.\n\nThe tribunal concluded that the anonymous testimony only served as one piece of a mosaic which enforced the conclusion drawn from the remaining evidence. It followed that the criminal courts were not prevented from taking this evidence into account.\n\nOn 12 February 2007 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s nullity appeal. On 19 April 2007 the Federal Tribunal rejected the applicant’s appeal.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 25088/07) against the Swiss Confederation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Swiss Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON], of the Federal Office of Justice.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his criminal conviction was based to a decisive extent on testimony given by an anonymous witness.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nHaving been informed on [DATE_TIME] of their right to submit written observations, the Government of Montenegro did not express an intention to take part in the proceedings.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME]. He is currently detained in a cantonal prison in [LOCATION] in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], shortly after [DATE_TIME], [PERSON] was killed by a gunshot in the back of his neck in front of the post-office in Zurich‑Schwamendingen. The applicant was suspected of having carried out the shooting.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the prosecution authority of the canton of [LOCATION] interrogated X as a witness. X declared that he had been at the crime scene and that he had been able to see, from a distance of twenty metres, that the applicant had shot the victim in the back of his neck. During the interrogations, the witness, the investigating judge, a police officer and a translator were sitting in a separate room, while the applicant, the former co‑accused [PERSON], their respective defence counsel and two police guards were sitting in another room. The interrogation was transmitted via a sound link, and the witness’ voice was distorted in order to protect the witness’ anonymity. Following the interrogation, the defence counsel were given the opportunity to put additional questions via the sound link.\n\nAt the beginning of each interrogation the applicant’s counsel declared that the modalities of the witness interrogations did not allow for an adequate exercise of the rights of the defence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], X was interrogated before the Jury Court of the canton of Zurich ([PERSON]). While the judges, the jury and an interpreter were sitting directly together with the witness in the hearing room, the applicant, his counsel, the interpreter, the civil parties, the public prosecutor and the journalists were placed in one of the court’s deliberation rooms. The interrogation was transmitted via a sound link and the witness’ voice was distorted in order to prevent his being identified.\n\nThe applicant and his counsel were allowed to put additional questions to X. The latter, however, refused to answer a number of questions which the defence counsel considered to be important, notably the following: “Why had X arranged a meeting with [PERSON]? How did X react after the crime? Did X approach the body? Did he wait for the police? Did he consume drugs? Was he afraid of someone close to the applicant? Had he been concretely threatened by someone? Did X have an argument with the applicant or with [PERSON]? Where did X go after the crime? Was he on foot or did he have a vehicle? Did he have a criminal record? Was he residing legally in [LOCATION]? Did he wear spectacles?”\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the jury court convicted the applicant of manslaughter (vorsätzliche Tötung) and of several counts of drug-trafficking and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME]’ detention. The court considered that the testimony given by X was credible and pertinent. It further considered that the conditions to allow the witness’ anonymity were met. It noted that X had submitted in a credible and convincing way that his life was in danger in case he testified, as persons close to the applicant and to [PERSON] were ready to take revenge and did not even hesitate to kill somebody. According to X’s submissions, he was the only person who had observed the crime and who dared to testify. It thus appeared comprehensible that X feared reprisals. It was further obvious that the applicant had a motive to take revenge on the witness who had contributed to his conviction and to prevent him from making further testimonies.\n\nThe fears expressed by X were in line with the overall picture conveyed by the other witnesses, who showed fear which was sometimes even bordering to panic when it came to making any concrete incriminating statements. The court considered that there were concrete indications that the applicant lived in an extremely violent environment in which recourse to violence and even to arms was frequent even for seemingly minor reasons. Moreover, there were specific indications that persons who had been ready to testify before the jury court had been exposed to death threats.\n\nThe court further considered that the measures taken were both necessary and sufficient to prevent identification of the witness X. The court had taken a number of measures to compensate the restrictions imposed on the rights of the defence. Firstly, the witness had not been examined by the regional prosecutor ([PERSON]), but by the president of the court. Secondly, the identity of X had been confirmed by the police-officer in charge of the investigation and had been known to the regional prosecutor and to the president of the court.\n\nThirdly, the police officer and the regional prosecutor gave testimony about X’s reputation and credibility. It had thus been known that X had no criminal record and that there was no indication that he had any contact with the drug trafficking scene. There was further no indication that X had been in any way involved in the crime. It was further known that X spoke the [NRP]-Croatian language. Conversely, the regional prosecutor refused to divulge any detailed information on X’s private and professional background, his education, his family situation and his residence status. The jury court considered, however, that this information was of minor importance for the assessment of credibility and that the information available gave the court a sound basis for assessing the general credibility of the witness.\n\nThe court further noted that X had been interrogated in front of the complete court and that all persons participating in the decision-making process could gain a personal impression of the witness and of his reaction to the questions put to him. Furthermore, the court had taken into account that, under the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, a conviction could not be exclusively based on testimony given by an anonymous witness. The principle of a public hearing had been safeguarded by allowing the press directly to follow the interrogation from the separate room in which the defence was seated. The court considered that the core rights of the defence had been safeguarded and that the measures taken had been proportionate.\n\nReferring to the Court’s case-law, the jury court considered that a criminal conviction must not be exclusively based on testimony given by an anonymous witness. Accordingly, the court considered that it could not rely on the anonymous witness’ testimony insofar as this constituted the only evidence available. The jury court resumed its examination by laying out general principles for the assessment of the credibility of evidence by witnesses. It considered that the applicant’s own submissions, according to which he could not have been present at the crime scene as he first entered [NRP] territory in [DATE_TIME] – and thus after the victim had been killed – were contradictory and thus lacked credibility. Conversely, the court considered the testimony given by the anonymous witness, who submitted that he had seen the applicant shooting the victim, to be credible.\n\nThe jury court further considered that there had been other evidence linking the applicant to the crime. There was, in particular, witness and circumstantial evidence allowing the conclusion that the applicant had been residing in the [LOCATION] region since [DATE_TIME], that he had known the victim and that he had engaged in drug trafficking with him. As regarded the shooting of the victim, the court considered that the statements made by the witness [PERSON], who had declared in a credible and convincing way to the police that the applicant had explained to him [DATE_TIME] after the incident that he had killed [PERSON] before the latter could kill him, weighed heavily against the applicant, notwithstanding the fact that [PERSON] did not repeat these allegations during the court proceedings, but stated that he could not remember what had happened. The testimony given by [PERSON] during the police investigation was supported by the convincing submissions made by the anonymous witness, and by testimony given by a witness who had presumably met the applicant immediately after the crime. Relying on all available evidence, the jury court concluded that there was no doubt that [PERSON] had been shot by the applicant. With regard to the concrete factual circumstances, the jury court considered that the prosecution based its submissions mainly on testimony given by the anonymous witness. It followed that, for formal reasons, these circumstances could not be taken into account and that it had to be assumed in the applicant’s favour that the concrete circumstances had not been proven. It followed that there was no sufficient factual basis which would allow the conclusion that the applicant acted with a particular degree of scrupulousness (besonders skrupellos) which would lead to the crime being characterised as murder.\n\nThe applicant lodged a nullity appeal (Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde) with the Court of Cassation (Kassationsgericht) of the canton of Zurich.\n\nBy decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the lower court. That court noted that the anonymous witness had been heard in camera and that the applicant’s counsel did not have the possibility directly to question the witness. Neither the applicant nor his counsel had ever seen the witness, whose personal details remained secret. The court further noted that the witness refused to answer a number of questions which the defence considered important (see paragraph 11, above). The court did not call into question that the legal conditions for granting anonymity were fulfilled in the instant case and confirmed the first instance court’s finding that it had been necessary to protect X against possible reprisals.\n\nWith regard to the applicant’s rights under Article 6 of the Convention, the court considered that the maintenance of the anonymity of the witness X and the fact that X had been shielded from sight and that his voice had been distorted seriously interfered with the defence’s right to confront the witness. The fact that the prosecution and the presiding judge were aware of the witness’ identity could not be regarded as a counterbalancing factor as such. Given the fact that all judges were accountable for the judgment, and that it was the role of the defence to examine the findings of the prosecution from the defendant’s point of view, it appeared problematic that the presiding judge had knowledge that was superior to that of the other members of the court, including the jury, and that the latter had more knowledge than the defence. Adequate compensation could only be conceivable if at least the defence had the right directly to take part in the interrogation of the witness and was given the opportunity to assess the witness’ credibility; however, this possibility was not granted in the instant case.\n\nRelying on the Court’s case-law (the court referred to the cases of [PERSON] v. the [LOCATION], [DATE_TIME], Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑II and [PERSON] and Others v. the [LOCATION], [DATE_TIME], Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997‑III), the court considered that the criminal court could not rely on the testimony given by the anonymous witness for two separate reasons: Firstly, according to the case-law of the Court, it was decisive whether the applicant’s defence counsel had been present during the interrogation of the anonymous witness or had at least been in a position to follow the interrogation via an audio‑visual link and to put questions. As this had not been the case, the modalities of the witness’ interrogation did not comply with the standards set up by the Court and were thus contrary to Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention.\n\nSecondly, the court examined whether the testimony given by the anonymous witness had to be regarded as being “decisive” for the applicant’s conviction within the meaning of the “sole or decisive” rule developed by the Court. It noted that the anonymous witness was the only direct witness of the crime at issue, as the remaining witnesses only gave evidence by hearsay. It was thus obvious that the anonymous witness’ testimony had more than only minor relevance for the assessment of the evidence. Even though the evidence given by other – indirect – witnesses carried a certain weight, the anonymous witness had to be regarded as the decisive evidence (“massgebliches [PERSON]”), and was decisive to an extent which, under the Court’s case-law, excluded the possibility of having recourse to this evidence in order to establish the applicant’s guilt.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the senior public prosecutor ([PERSON]) of the [LOCATION] of [LOCATION] lodged a nullity appeal against the decision of the Court of Cassation.\n\nBy judgment of [DATE_TIME] the Federal Tribunal ([PERSON]) quashed the decision of [DATE_TIME] and remitted the case to the Court of Cassation. That court considered that the lower court’s judgment did not comply with the principle of free appreciation of the evidence under Article 249 of the Federal Law on Criminal Procedure ([PERSON] der freien Beweiswürdigung, see relevant domestic law, below).\n\nThe Federal Tribunal confirmed that it had been necessary to protect the witness by shielding his appearance both from the applicant and from the applicant’s counsel. It considered that the counsel was not under any legal obligation to transmit information on the witness’ identity to the applicant. Even if such a duty existed, the risk that the defence counsel did not respect this obligation or inadvertently divulged information to his client was unacceptably high. The tribunal further considered that it was compatible with Article 6 of the Convention to consider the testimony given by an anonymous witness insofar as it could complete – like a mosaic stone – the picture gained through other evidence, which was in itself not sufficient to support an establishment of guilt, but established a strong suspicion, and thus contributed to a full establishment of guilt.\n\nThe tribunal further reviewed the other evidence examined by the jury court and concluded that this evidence, taken separately, would have been sufficient “to establish a strong suspicion of a criminal offence, or even to establish his guilt”. The tribunal reiterated that the jury court had considered that the testimony given by the witness X had been credible and that it was, furthermore, in line with the scientific conclusion that the victim had been killed by gunshot in the back of his neck on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe tribunal concluded that the anonymous testimony only served as one piece of a mosaic which enforced the conclusion drawn from the remaining evidence. It followed that the criminal courts were not prevented from taking this evidence into account.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s nullity appeal. On [DATE_TIME] the Federal Tribunal rejected the applicant’s appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28388/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Nurcan Güngil (“the applicant”), on 30 July 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs İ. İlimoğlu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 20 November 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the civil proceedings. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Ankara.\n\nOn 2 and 3 May 1995 the applicant deposited a total of 1,537,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) with Global A.Ş., a private brokerage firm, and requested the firm to buy Treasury bonds for her.\n\nIn September 1995 the applicant contacted B.G., the broker to whom she had given the money, and asked her whether she had bought the Treasury bonds on her behalf. B.G. informed the applicant, by way of a handwritten document, that she had.\n\nOn 15 March 1996 when the applicant went to the office of Global A.Ş., she learned that B.G. had used her money not to buy Treasury bonds but to buy stocks, which had lost their value and therefore the firm had caused her to lose money.\n\nOn 30 September 1996 the applicant brought a case against Global A.Ş. and B.G. before the Ankara Commercial Court (Asliye Ticaret Mahkemesi), requesting the defendants to reimburse the money which she had deposited with the firm.\n\nOn 27 May 1998 the Ankara Commercial Court partially granted the applicant’s request and ordered the defendants to pay her TRL 942,000,000 with simple interest.\n\nBoth the applicant and the defendants appealed.\n\nOn 26 October 2000 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 27 May 1998. The case was subsequently remitted to the Ankara Commercial Court.\n\nOn 7 November 2001 the Ankara Commercial Court once again partially granted the applicant’s request and ordered Global A.Ş. and B.G. to pay her TRL 1,512,000,000 with simple interest.\n\nThe applicant and Global A.Ş. appealed.\n\nOn 10 October 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 7 November 2001.\n\nOn 13 January 2003 the applicant requested rectification of the Court of Cassation’s decision of 10 October 2002.\n\nOn 11 April 2003 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s request.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 3429/07) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Maria Korcz (“the applicant”), on 20 July 2007.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 10 November 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Poznań.\n\nA. Background of the case\n\nBy an administrative decision of 29 June 1978 of the Head of the Dominowo District (Naczelnik Gminy) the real estate owned by the applicant’s husband was transferred to his son – S.K. Neither the applicant’s husband nor the applicant was informed by the authorities about this decision.\n\nIn 1990 the applicant’s husband died in a car accident.\n\nB. Administrative proceedings for retrospective leave to appeal\n\nOn 11 February 1999 the applicant filed a request with the Commune Office (Urząd Gminy) for retrospective leave to appeal against the decision of 29 June 1978.\n\nOn 23 February and 17 March 1999 the applicant was informed by the Mayor of the Dominowo Commune (Wójt Gminy) that her request had been left without consideration.\n\nOn 22 March 1999 she complained to the Head of the Commune Council (Przewodniczący Rady Gminy) about the fact that her case had been left without consideration and that no decision had been taken on it. She did not receive any answer.\n\nOn 14 January 2001 the applicant repeated her request for retrospective leave to appeal against the decision of 29 June 1978.\n\nOn 6 December 2000 the Commune Office (Urząd Gminy) informed the applicant that her request could not be dealt with since the case file had been sent to the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Admnistracyjny).\n\nOn 3 March 2005 the applicant complained to the Commune Office about the delay. She asked for the proceedings to be accelerated.\n\nOn 5 April 2005 she lodged a complaint about the inactivity of the Mayor of the Commune with the Regional Administrative Court (Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny).\n\nOn 9 June 2005 the Regional Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s complaint, since the applicant had failed to lodge it in accordance with the formal requirements set out in Polish law, namely she had failed to lodge a complaint with the administrative authority under Article 37 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.\n\nOn 3 February 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint about the inactivity of the Mayor of the Dominowo Commune with the Self‑Government Board of Appeal (Samorządowe Kolegium Odwoławcze). The complaint was referred to the Dominowo Commune Council, being the competent administrative authority.\n\nBy a resolution of 30 August 2006 her complaint was dismissed as ill-founded.\n\nOn 4 January 2007 she lodged a complaint about the inactivity of the Mayor of the Dominowo Commune with the Regional Administrative Court. She submitted that she had lodged numerous complaints with different administrative authorities, her case had been pending for 8 years and no decision had been given on it.\n\nOn 5 December 2007 the Regional Administrative Court found the complaint well-founded. It held that the proceedings in the applicant’s case had exceeded a reasonable time and ordered the Mayor of the Dominowo Commune to proceed speedily with the case.\n\nOn 8 April 2008 the Self-Government Board of Appeal decided to grant the applicant retrospective leave to appeal against the decision of 29 June 1978.",

Kadirhan and Ms G. Tuncer, lawyers practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 19 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (former Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and detained in Kandıra prison.\n\nOn 3 March 1997 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 14 March 1997 the applicant was examined by a doctor. The medical report drawn up by the doctor indicated that there was hyperaemia on the applicant's thighs.\n\nOn the same day the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor, where he stated that he had been stripped and hosed with water under police custody.\n\nOn the same day the judge at the İstanbul State Security Court ordered his pre-trial detention. Before the judge the applicant stated that his statement in police custody had been taken under torture, but he did not give any details.\n\nOn 28 April 1997 the public prosecutor at the İstanbul State Security Court issued an indictment charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn 7 July 1997 the applicant stated before the İstanbul State Security Court that his statement in police custody had been taken under torture, without giving any details.\n\nOn 26 April 2002 the İstanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn 12 May 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 26 April 2002.\n\nBy Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant was subsequently resumed before the İstanbul Assize Court.\n\nOn 25 December 2008 and 9 April 2009 the applicant objected to his continued detention and requested his release. The 11th Chamber of the İstanbul Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections on 14 January and 15 April 2009 respectively, having regard to the nature of the offence in question and to the state of the evidence. No hearing was held.\n\nOn 2 April 2009 the İstanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant.\n\nAccording to information in the case file, the case is pending before the Court of Cassation.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the first instance courts examined the applicant's continued detention at the end of each hearing, either on their own motion or upon the applicant's requests. Each time the courts ordered the applicant's continued detention having regard to the state of the evidence, the nature of the offence, the strong suspicion of his having committed the offence in issue, the danger of flight, the overall period of the pre-trial detention, and the persistence of the grounds for the continued detention.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 23480/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON] and [PERSON], lawyers practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (former Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and detained in Kandıra prison.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was examined by a doctor. The medical report drawn up by the doctor indicated that there was hyperaemia on the applicant's thighs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor, where he stated that he had been stripped and hosed with water under police custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the judge at the İstanbul State Security Court ordered his pre-trial detention. Before the judge the applicant stated that his statement in police custody had been taken under torture, but he did not give any details.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor at the İstanbul State Security Court issued an indictment charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant stated before the İstanbul State Security Court that his statement in police custody had been taken under torture, without giving any details.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the İstanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 of the former Criminal Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of [DATE_TIME].\n\nBy Law no. 5190 of [DATE_TIME], published in the Official Gazette on [DATE_TIME], State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant was subsequently resumed before the İstanbul Assize Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the applicant objected to his continued detention and requested his release. The 11th Chamber of the İstanbul Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections on [DATE_TIME] respectively, having regard to the nature of the offence in question and to the state of the evidence. No hearing was held.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the İstanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant.\n\nAccording to information in the case file, the case is pending before the Court of Cassation.\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the first instance courts examined the applicant's continued detention at the end of each hearing, either on their own motion or upon the applicant's requests. Each time the courts ordered the applicant's continued detention having regard to the state of the evidence, the nature of the offence, the strong suspicion of his having committed the offence in issue, the danger of flight, the overall period of the pre-trial detention, and the persistence of the grounds for the continued detention.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 32098/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Ms Marianna Cieślak (“the applicant”), on 10 August 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 27 September 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Ms Marianna Cieślak, is a Polish national who was born in 1923 and lives in Bobolice.\n\nA. Proceedings for expropriation and civil proceedings for repossession\n\nThe applicant’s mother-in-law died on 6 October 1975. During the proceedings for division of inheritance, on 30 October 1980 the Mayor of Warsaw’s Wola District (Naczelnik Dzielnicy Warszawa Wola – hereafter, “the Mayor”) expropriated part of the land belonging to the applicant’s family.\n\nOn 22 February 1981 the applicant’s husband inherited the plot of land in Warsaw. On 17 August 1988, after his death, the applicant became the co-owner of the land.\n\nThe applicant instituted proceedings for annulment of the Mayor’s decision. On 22 March 1991 the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny) decided that the expropriation decision had been taken in flagrant infringement of the law.\n\nOn 29 February 1996 the Warsaw Governor’s Office (Urząd Wojewódzki) quashed the Mayor’s decision and dismissed an application by the Polish Allotment Association (Polski Związek Działkowy) for expropriation of the land. The Association appealed. On 20 January 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Warsaw Governor’s Office’s decision.\n\nOn 10 March 1995 the applicant and two other plaintiffs lodged with the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a claim for repossession of the expropriated land. The case was transmitted to the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nOn 21 November 2000 the Regional Court gave a preliminary judgment (wyrok wstępny). It decided that the property should be returned, and the parties should retain possession of the land until financial claims had been completed. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 18 January 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) quashed the Regional Court’s judgment on the right to retain possession until the completion of financial claims.\n\nOn 25 February 2004 the Regional Court gave judgment. It decided that the property should be returned. The Polish Allotment Association appealed.\n\nOn 20 December 2005 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. On 15 June 2006 it issued a writ of enforcement.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 22 January 2005 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Court of Appeal a complaint under the provisions of the 17 June 2004 Act on complaints about a breach of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 Act”), which entered into force on 17 September 2004.\n\nOn 23 March 2005 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court held that the 2004 Act had legal effect from its date of entry into force. It found that during the relevant part of the proceedings there had been no inactivity or undue delay on the part of the domestic court. In that connection, the court held that there had been no breach of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time in the period after 17 September 2004.",

In that connection, the court held that there had been no breach of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time in the period after [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 473/07) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Mirosław Wroński (“the applicant”), on 18 December 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 April 2008 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Gdynia.\n\nA. Disciplinary proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 30 March 1993 the Chief of the Gdańsk Regional Police Headquarters (Komenda Wojewódzka Policji) dismissed the applicant from the police service (he was held accountable for accepting bribes).\n\nOn 14 May 1993 the Chief of the Principal Police Headquarters (Komenda Główna Policji) upheld the decision.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nIn November 1992 the Gdynia prosecution authorities charged the applicant, a serving police officer at the time, with numerous counts of fraud.\n\nOn 30 June 1993 a bill of indictment against the applicant and eleven other suspects was lodged with the Gdynia District Court (Sąd Rejonowy).\n\nThe applicant did not submit any information concerning the court’s hearings between July 1993 and January 2005.\n\nTwo hearings, scheduled on 1 February and 8 March 2005, were adjourned as some of the suspects failed to appear.\n\nTwo hearings, scheduled on 12 April and 10 May 2005, were cancelled due to the judge’s illness.\n\nOn 7 June 2005 the court severed the charges against the applicant and four other accused.\n\nSubsequently, the trial court held hearings on 12 and 26 July, 6 September, 12 October, 17 November and 12 December 2005, and 18 January, 15 February, 15 March, 19 April, 5 and 29 June and 19 July 2006.\n\nOn 21 July 2006 the Gdynia District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to one year and six months’ imprisonment and a fine of 800 Polish zlotys (PLN).\n\nOn 25 September 2006 the applicant appealed.\n\nOn 11 December 2006 his appeal was dismissed by the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nC. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 2 October 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) and asked for just satisfaction.\n\nOn 13 November 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed his complaint. It limited its examination of the length of proceedings issue to the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act and stressed that the Act could not be applied to the protracted length of court proceedings occurring before that date. Having analysed the conduct of the District Court during the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the Regional Court found that there were no delays for which the District Court could be held responsible. Pointing to the complexity of the case and the voluminous documentation gathered in the proceedings it held that the proceedings had been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time.",

It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).\n\nThe Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike out the application, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Disciplinary proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chief of the Gdańsk Regional Police Headquarters (Komenda Wojewódzka Policji) dismissed the applicant from the police service (he was held accountable for accepting bribes).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chief of the Principal Police Headquarters (Komenda Główna Policji) upheld the decision.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] prosecution authorities charged the applicant, a serving police officer at the time, with numerous counts of fraud.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a bill of indictment against the applicant and eleven other suspects was lodged with the Gdynia District Court ([PERSON]).\n\nThe applicant did not submit any information concerning the court’s hearings [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nTwo hearings, scheduled on [DATE_TIME], were adjourned as some of the suspects failed to appear.\n\nTwo hearings, scheduled on [DATE_TIME], were cancelled due to the judge’s illness.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court severed the charges against the applicant and four other accused.\n\nSubsequently, the trial court held hearings on 12 and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdynia District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment and a fine of 800 Polish zlotys (PLN).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] his appeal was dismissed by the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nC. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) and asked for just satisfaction.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed his complaint. It limited its examination of the length of proceedings issue to the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act and stressed that the Act could not be applied to the protracted length of court proceedings occurring before that date. Having analysed the conduct of the District Court during the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the Regional Court found that there were no delays for which the District Court could be held responsible.

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 12550/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Polish nationals, Mr Zdzisław Olesiński and Mrs Helena Olesińska (“the applicants”), on 28 March 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 19 January 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1925 and 1927, respectively, and live in Lublin, Poland.\n\nOn 21 May 1993 the applicants' neighbours were granted a permission to construct a shop on the ground floor of their house. The applicants appealed but the decision was upheld on 19 July 1993.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1994 the applicants applied to have the decision declared null and void. They submitted that the decision had been issued in violation of the local zoning plan and that the shop had been causing them nuisance.\n\nOn 11 April 1994 the Minister of Planning (Minister Gospodarki Przestrzennej i Budownictwa) dismissed their application. The applicants appealed.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the Chief Building Inspector (Główny Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego) allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned decision.\n\nThe Chief Building Inspector informed the applicants in his letters of 30 December 1995, 30 January, 28 February and 26 March 1996 that the proceedings could not be terminated yet and that he had fixed new time-limits. The Inspector explained that the main reason for the delay had been the necessity to obtain an expert opinion, which had been ultimately submitted on 9 April 1996.\n\nOn 18 April 1996 the Chief Building Inspector refused to annul the decision of 21 May 1993. The Inspector informed the applicants that the decision was final and that they could lodge a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny).\n\nOn 4 June 1996 the first applicant lodged a complaint against the decision with the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nOn 23 April 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court held a hearing and rejected the applicant's complaint as it had been lodged in breach of procedural requirements. The court established that the applicant should have first lodged an appeal with the Chief Building Inspector asking him to reconsider the case. The court further advised the applicant that since the procedural mistake had occurred due to his being wrongly advised by the Inspector in the decision of 18 April 1996, he could apply for leave to appeal out of time.\n\nOn 25 May 1998 the first applicant appealed to the Inspector to reconsider the case and applied for leave to lodge an appeal out of time.\n\nOn 4 June 1998 the Chief Building Inspector granted leave to appeal out of time, examined the appeal, and upheld his decision of 18 April 1996.\n\nOn 30 September 1998 the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court against the decision of 4 June 1998.\n\nOn 5 October 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the complaint.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. [PHONE_NUMBER]) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two [NRP] nationals, Mr [PERSON] and [PERSON] (“the applicants”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], respectively, and live in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicants' neighbours were granted a permission to construct a shop on the ground floor of their house. The applicants appealed but the decision was upheld on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn an unspecified date in [DATE_TIME] the applicants applied to have the decision declared null and void. They submitted that the decision had been issued in violation of the local zoning plan and that the shop had been causing them nuisance.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Minister of Planning (Minister [PERSON] i Budownictwa) dismissed their application. The applicants appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chief Building Inspector ([PERSON]) allowed the appeal and quashed the impugned decision.\n\nThe Chief Building Inspector informed the applicants in his letters of [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] that the proceedings could not be terminated yet and that he had fixed new time-limits. The Inspector explained that the main reason for the delay had been the necessity to obtain an expert opinion, which had been ultimately submitted on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chief Building Inspector refused to annul the decision of [DATE_TIME]. The Inspector informed the applicants that the decision was final and that they could lodge a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court ([PERSON]).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the first applicant lodged a complaint against the decision with the Supreme Administrative Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court held a hearing and rejected the applicant's complaint as it had been lodged in breach of procedural requirements. The court established that the applicant should have first lodged an appeal with the Chief Building Inspector asking him to reconsider the case. The court further advised the applicant that since the procedural mistake had occurred due to his being wrongly advised by the Inspector in the decision of [DATE_TIME], he could apply for leave to appeal out of time.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the first applicant appealed to the Inspector to reconsider the case and applied for leave to lodge an appeal out of time.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chief Building Inspector granted leave to appeal out of time, examined the appeal, and upheld his decision of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court against the decision of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the complaint.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the German Government (“the Government“) on 10 August 1992 and by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on 11 September 1992, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 15473/89) against Germany lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 11 July 1989 by two German citizens, Mrs Hildegard Klaas and her daughter Monika Klaas, hereinafter referred to as the first and second applicant respectively. The Government’s request referred to Articles 32 and 48 (art. 32, art. 48); the Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Germany recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 3 and 8 (art. 3, art. 8) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent them (Rule 30). The President gave the lawyer leave to use the German language (Rule 27 para. 3).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr R. Bernhardt, the elected judge of German nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 26 September 1992 the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla and Mr A.B. Baka (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nMr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Deputy Registrar, consulted the applicants’ lawyer, the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received, on 7 December 1992, the Government’s memorial and, on 19 January 1993, the applicants’ observations. Various documents were produced by the Commission on 4 February 1993 and by the Government on 24 March 1993, at the request of the Registrar. On 9 February 1993 the Registrar was informed that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the President - who had also given the Agent of the Government leave to plead in German (Rule 27 para. 2) - the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 24 March 1993. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr J. Meyer-Ladewig, Ministerialdirigent, Federal Ministry of Justice, Agent;\n\nfor the Commission Mr J. Frowein, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicants Mr M. Stüben, Rechtsanwalt, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Meyer-Ladewig for the Government, by Mr Frowein for the Commission and by Mr Stüben for the applicants, as well as replies to its questions and by two of its members individually.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nAt about 7.30 p.m. on 28 January 1986, the first applicant, a social worker, drew up outside the back entrance to the block of flats in Lemgo where she lived. She was accompanied by her daughter Monika, who, at the time of the incident that gave rise to the complaint, was eight years old. After she had opened the gate she was stopped by two police officers who had followed her and were standing in the gateway. They accused her of having driven through a red traffic light and of having tried to get away - an allegation denied by the applicant. The police officers claimed to have detected a strong smell of alcohol on her breath when they checked her driving licence. She agreed to be breathalysed. Despite having been shown what to do, she proved unable to provide a specimen of breath satisfactorily and was therefore told that she would have to accompany the police officers to the local hospital in order to have a blood test. An altercation followed during which Mrs Klaas was arrested. The precise course of the events is disputed by the applicants (see paragraph 7 below) and the police officers (see paragraph 9 below). She was then driven to the hospital for the blood test, which showed the level of alcohol in her blood to be 0.82 per ml (milligrammes per millilitre). She was subsequently released.\n\nAccording to the applicants, Mrs Klaas agreed to have a blood sample taken, but explained that she wished first to accompany her daughter to a neighbour. One of the police officers refused to allow this and dragged her to the police car. She was warned that she could be charged with obstructing a public officer in the execution of his duties (Widerstand gegen die Staatsgewalt). When she called her daughter, the police officers said that they would look after the child. Thereupon she took her daughter by the hand, went to the back door, rang her neighbour’s doorbell and opened the door. At that moment one of the police officers grabbed her, twisted her left arm behind her back and her head knocked against the corner of the window- ledge. The police officers then handcuffed her. She lost consciousness for a short while. When she came round, she found herself by the police car and noticed severe pain in her left shoulder, which was being pressed towards her back by one of the police officers. She was subsequently able to get into the police car and was driven to the hospital.\n\nThe first applicant underwent two medical examinations. On 11 February 1986, Dr Schwering certified that he had examined the applicant on 29 January and noticed bruises which were about 10cm long on her right arm, considerable problems in moving her left shoulder, and bruises on that shoulder. He also stated that she would suffer long-term problems, in particular with her left shoulder. She was put on sick-leave until 8 February 1986. Furthermore, on 10 February 1986, Dr Krauspe, the chief surgeon at the local hospital, certified that he had examined the first applicant on 30 January 1986 and had reached an almost identical diagnosis.\n\nI. THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST THE FIRST APPLICANT\n\nOn 29 January 1986, Police Constable (Polizeimeister) Bolte laid an information against the first applicant. She was charged with obstructing a public officer in the execution of his duties contrary to Article 113 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), and of driving while under the influence of alcohol contrary to Article 316 of the said code. Police Constable Bolte stated in his report that after Mrs Klaas had been informed that she had to undergo a blood test, she had attempted to escape into the darkness of the back-yard, whereupon he had grabbed her arm and stopped her. The applicant had been very aggressive. When informed that she was to be arrested, she had suddenly calmed down and declared that she would come along when she had taken her daughter, whom he had assumed to be about twelve years old, to a neighbour. The police officers had agreed in order to avoid a further escalation of the events. They had followed the applicants to the back door of the house. The first applicant had been about to follow her daughter into the house. She tried to close the door behind her but Police Constable Wildschut blocked the door open and Police Constable Bolte grabbed the first applicant’s right arm and pulled her outside. The child went upstairs. According to the report, Mrs Klaas struggled, struck out and tried to free herself from the police officer’s grip. Police Constable Wildschut took her left arm and twisted it behind her back, whilst Police Constable Bolte kept a tight grip on her right arm. With great difficulty the officers managed to control the applicant, who was putting up a fight. They handcuffed her in order to avoid further criminal offences being committed, in particular injury to the person. On their way to the police car she had attempted to throw herself to the ground, and he and his colleague had had to hold her arms. At that point another police car arrived. However, by that time, the applicant’s neighbour had already offered to take care of the child. The officers noted on arrival at Lemgo Hospital that Mrs Klaas had a graze on her right temple.\n\nOn 22 April 1986 the criminal proceedings against the first applicant were discontinued by the public prosecutor’s office (Staatsanwaltschaft) at the Detmold Regional Court (Landgericht) for two different reasons, namely that the offence of driving while under the influence of alcohol was not proven and that the applicant’s guilt in resisting the police officers had been minimal (gering) and there was no public interest in prosecuting. In November 1986 the competent administrative authority imposed an administrative fine of DM 500 for having committed the “regulatory offence“ (Ordnungswidrigkeit) of driving with a blood alcohol content level of 0.82 per ml when 0.80 per ml was the legal limit. A driving ban of one month was also imposed. The Lemgo District Court (Amtsgericht) confirmed this decision. The first applicant’s subsequent appeal to the Hamm Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) and to the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) were dismissed.\n\nII. PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY THE FIRST APPLICANT AGAINST THE POLICE OFFICERS\n\nOn 24 April 1986 the first applicant laid an information against the police officers concerned. She alleged that they had assaulted her contrary to Articles 223 and 230 of the Criminal Code. In her pleadings of 24 April and 13 May 1986, Mrs Klaas claimed that the police officers had used a disproportionate amount of force, causing injuries to her head, left shoulder and upper right arm. On 10 July 1986, following a telephone conversation between her lawyer and an official of the public prosecutor’s office in which Mrs Klaas’ allegations were withdrawn - allegedly after a warning that criminal proceedings against her would otherwise be continued - the proceedings against the police officers were discontinued.\n\nOn 18 July 1986, the first applicant filed a complaint (Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde) with the Head of the Detmold District Administration (Oberkreisdirektor) against the police officers involved in the arrest. She stated that she had wanted to wait for her neighbour to come to the door but that she had not been able to as the bearded police officer had twisted her arm behind her back and her head knocked against the brick window-ledge. Subsequently she was forcibly taken to the police car where she was held with her back up against the rear of the car. The bearded man continued to pull her left shoulder back at regular intervals. At some point she was dazed. She maintained that the blood test showed the level of alcohol to be 0.80 per ml. It was argued that the degree of force used against an unarmed woman was incomprehensible on an objective or subjective analysis; the mildest means of achieving the objective should have been employed.\n\nOn 18 September 1986, the Head of the Detmold District Administration, acting as the Police Department authority (Kreispolizeibehörde), dismissed her complaint. In the decision, it was stated in particular that after she had been informed that she would have to give a blood sample, she had attempted to run away. However, one of the police officers seized her arm and told her that she was under arrest. Her request to take her daughter to a neighbour’s first was granted. When the first applicant opened the door and tried to enter with her daughter, one of the police officers held her right arm fast, whereupon she started to kick and to hit out with her left hand. When the police officers held her tight she tried to escape. She had to be handcuffed. It was not accepted that her head knocked against the window-ledge at any moment in the course of the arrest. He concluded that the use of force had been justified and was not disproportionate to the aim pursued, namely the taking of a blood test.\n\nIII. THE FIRST APPLICANT’S PROCEEDINGS FOR COMPENSATION UNDER CIVIL LAW\n\nThe first applicant instituted civil proceedings in April 1987 against the Land North-Rhine Westphalia and the police officers concerned. She claimed compensation for the injuries sustained on 28 January 1986.\n\nOn 10 July 1987 the Detmold Regional Court, in a partial judgment, dismissed her complaint against the police officers on the ground that an official acting in the exercise of his duties does not incur personal liability.\n\nOn 9 October 1987 the Detmold Regional Court held a hearing in the case. The applicant’s neighbour was the first to give evidence. She said that she had noticed Mrs Klaas’s very blotchy and tear-stained face despite the dim light, had seen the blond police officer holding her arms behind her back and had feared that she would collapse at any moment as her knees had given way and she had bent forward suddenly several times. The neighbour stated on further questioning that, judging from the first applicant’s behaviour, she must have been in terrible pain. The first applicant complained about the pain in her left shoulder and asked the police officers to remove the handcuffs. This request was repeated by the neighbour but refused by the police officers. Police Constable Bolte confirmed the facts as set out in his report of 29 January 1986 (see paragraph 9 above). He added that he was not sure whether the first applicant had deliberately not blown into the breathalyser for a sufficient time or whether she had had genuine difficulties. He stated that she had not knocked her head against the wall when she was pulled outside, however he remained unable to account for the injury to her right cheek to which he had referred in the aforementioned report. Upon further questioning he corroborated the neighbour’s evidence that Mrs Klaas had requested that the handcuffs be removed and he explained that they had refused this request as they had feared more trouble. He said that she had not complained about any pains in her shoulder and that she had certainly not knocked her head against the wall. However, he acknowledged that she did not have the head injury before they spoke to her and said that he did not know whether she had got the injury to her right cheek during the scuffle when the handcuffs had been put on. He could not remember who had kept hold of Mrs Klaas until they had put her into the police car, or whether she had bent forward suddenly owing, for instance, to a jerking on her handcuffs and the resulting pain. Police Constable Wildschut was the next to give evidence. He confirmed the general circumstances of the first applicant’s arrest as described by Police Constable Bolte, although he was not prepared to say that she had run away. After the applicant had opened the front door she had attempted to close it behind her but he had held on to it while his colleague kept a tight grip on her. As it was completely dark just outside the door he could not exclude the possibility that she could have knocked her head on the wall or on something else. In any event he did not notice it happening and it was only later that he became aware of her head injury. He stated that Mrs Klaas had vehemently resisted arrest which was why he had taken her left arm and twisted it behind her back and then handcuffed her arms in that position. He could not remember whether she had been handcuffed in the back-yard or whether they had first taken her to the street. He confirmed that she had requested that the handcuffs be removed but did not remember her complaining about any pain - in particular pain in her left shoulder. She continued, without success, to resist accompanying them, but he could not be sure who had been holding on to her while they waited for the second police car. On further questioning Police Constable Wildschut stated that he did not remember whether she had bent forward suddenly while she was still handcuffed. She had resisted arrest and had been lashing out when he had twisted her arm behind her back, but he assumed that she had not intended to assault either him or his colleague. He denied that he had pushed the first applicant’s head against the window-ledge. Finally, the second applicant, Monika, gave evidence. She stated that she remembered the incident with her mother and the police officers in their back-yard. She said, in particular, that her mother had rung the doorbell and opened the door using a key. Monika had then gone into the house and closed the door behind her. She was not aware that one of the police officers had forcibly kept the door open. Having closed the door behind her, she said that she had managed to see through the plain glass door panel that one of the police officers had pushed her mother’s head against the wall. She emphasised that the police officer had repeatedly pushed her mother’s head against the wall next to the door using his hand. The officer concerned had blond hair. Her mother and the police officer had been close to the door, approximately one metre away from it. She herself had not been right in front of the glass panel. She had subsequently run upstairs to their neighbour. She further explained that, when her mother had rung the doorbell and opened the door, she had been standing to Monika’s right. Her mother had opened the door only a little bit, and she had just been able to get in. She had then immediately closed the door behind her. Whilst she did not recognise the police officers involved she thought that the dark-haired police officer had a beard. She confirmed that the light had been poor, but said that it had been light in the staircase. She had not seen either of the police officers twisting her mother’s arm behind her back.\n\nOn 30 October 1987 the Detmold Regional Court dismissed the first applicant’s compensation claims against the Land North-Rhine Westphalia. It held as follows: “The plaintiff has no claim under Articles 839 and 847 of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) taken together with Article 34 of the Basic Law for breach of official duty to her on the part of Police Constables Bolte and Wildschut. The Chamber is admittedly convinced that the plaintiff incurred the injuries complained of when she was arrested by the two police officers. In any event the plaintiff ended up with a graze on her temple, contusion of the left shoulder and probably also concussion, as was also confirmed in part by witnesses Bolte and Wildschut and moreover does not seem to be seriously contested by the defendant Land. These injuries were probably sustained by the plaintiff in the context of her arrest. It does not follow, however, that the defendant Land is liable in damages. The arrest itself was not unlawful. Even if the plaintiff had no intention whatsoever to abscond, the situation nevertheless appeared otherwise to the police officers. The plaintiff was under suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, namely driving under the influence of alcohol in road traffic contrary to Article 316 of the Criminal Code, as the police officers had found that the plaintiff’s breath smelt of alcohol. On the basis of the credible statements of witnesses Bolte and Wildschut, the Chamber also assumes that the plaintiff’s conduct, first after failing to blow satisfactorily into the breathalyser and then later at the front door, gave both witnesses the impression that she intended to evade further investigation, namely the taking of a blood sample, by absconding. The Chamber can understand that the police officers could have foreseen very considerable difficulties if the plaintiff managed to get into the building without the two witnesses. First, the police officers could not know whether the plaintiff would have allowed them access to her flat at all. Secondly, the plaintiff would have had an opportunity of consuming more alcohol or at least claiming that she had done so, thereby making ascertainment of her blood alcohol level impossible or significantly more difficult to obtain. In the light of these circumstances the arrest does not appear to be disproportionate either, but a perfectly reasonable means of ensuring that the further investigations could be carried out. It is for the plaintiff to prove that in this initially lawful exercise of their duty the police officers went further than was necessary, by handling the plaintiff too roughly and in so doing injuring her or even by deliberately inflicting the injuries on her. Just as an attacker must prove that a person attacked by him, acting in self-defence, exceeded the limits of necessary self-defence (see Federal Court of Justice - Bundesgerichtshof -, Versicherungsrecht 1971, pp. 629 et seq.), so also, in the Chamber’s opinion, must this apply in a case such as the present one: a person who puts forward claims in respect of injuries suffered during a lawful arrest must prove that the police officers went beyond what was necessary and thereby caused the injuries. The plaintiff, however, has not succeeded in providing such proof. On the evidence which has been taken, the Chamber is not convinced that the police officers caused the plaintiff’s injuries by exceeding what was necessary when arresting her. With respect to the origin of the graze, the evidence of witness Monika Klaas, the plaintiff’s daughter, conflicts with that of witnesses Bolte and Wildschut. Whereas witness Klaas claims to have seen one of the police officers repeatedly knocking the plaintiff’s head against the wall by the door, the two police officers deny this. None of these three witnesses can be regarded as not having an interest in these proceedings; the two police officers could certainly expect disciplinary proceedings and a resumption of the criminal investigation if these proved to be the facts, while witness Klaas has a natural interest in supporting her mother’s claim and account of the facts. It is not clear to the Chamber which of the statements corresponds to what really happened. Definite findings of fact can therefore not be made in this respect. The largely disinterested witness Krüger [the neighbour] was unable in her testimony to confirm the plaintiff’s assertion that witness Wildschut had pulled her arms upwards while she was handcuffed. Neither can such a conclusion be drawn merely from the fact that according to witness Krüger’s statements the plaintiff leant forward jerkily several times while witness Wildschut stood behind her. Neither the balance of probability nor general experience militate in favour of accepting the plaintiff’s version of events. The Chamber considers it by no means improbable that the plaintiff sustained all her injuries when she resisted being handcuffed. In the process her head could easily have knocked against the wall; the shoulder contusion could also have occurred when she struggled while being restrained by the police and when the handcuffs were being put on her. For these reasons the claim must be dismissed.“\n\nOn 21 September 1988 the Hamm Court of Appeal dismissed the first applicant’s appeal. It upheld the decision of the Detmold Regional Court that Mrs Klaas had not proved that excessive force had been used against her by the police officers.\n\nOn 8 February 1989 a panel of three judges of the Federal Constitutional Court declined to accept for adjudication the first applicant’s constitutional complaint on the ground that it did not offer sufficient prospects of success. It considered in particular that the Court of Appeal’s assessment of the evidence did not appear arbitrary or otherwise in violation of constitutional law. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nIn an application (no. 15473/89) lodged with the Commission on 11 July 1989, Mrs Hildegard Klaas, the first applicant, submitted that, in the presence of her daughter, Monika, she had been subjected in the course of her arrest to inhuman and degrading treatment by the police contrary to Article 3 (art. 3) and that this treatment had violated her right guaranteed under Article 8 (art. 8) to respect for her private and family life. Monika Klaas, the second applicant, contended that the aforementioned treatment of her mother in her presence had violated her right to respect for her private and family life, contrary to Article 8 (art. 8), in addition to subjecting her to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3).\n\nOn 9 July 1991 the Commission declared the applicants’ complaints admissible and in its report of 21 May 1992 (Article 31) (art. 31), expressed the opinion: (a) by ten votes to five that there had been a violation of Article 3 (art. 3) in respect of the first applicant; (b) by ten votes to five that no separate issue had arisen under Article 8 (art. 8) in respect of the first applicant; (c) by fourteen votes to one that there had been no violation of Article 3 (art. 3) in respect of the second applicant; (d) by eight votes to seven that there had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) in respect of the second applicant. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the various separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment. FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nThe Government in their memorial of 12 November 1992 invited the Court to find “that the applicants did not suffer violations of their rights under Article 3 (art. 3) or Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention“.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the German Government (“the Government“) on [DATE_TIME] and by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) on [DATE_TIME], within the [DATE_TIME] period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 15473/89) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on [DATE_TIME] by two [NRP] citizens, [PERSON] and her daughter [PERSON], hereinafter referred to as the first and second applicant respectively. The Government’s request referred to Articles 32 and [DATE_TIME] (art. [DATE_TIME], art. 48); the Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and [DATE_TIME] (art. [DATE_TIME], art. 48) and to the declaration whereby [LOCATION] recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 3 and 8 (art. 3, art. 8) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent them (Rule 30). The President gave the lawyer leave to use the [NRP] language (Rule 27 para. 3).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr [PERSON], the elected judge of [NRP] nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr [PERSON], the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On [DATE_TIME] the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr [PERSON], Mr L.-E. [PERSON], Mr B. Walsh, Mr [PERSON], Mr I. Foighel, Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nMr [PERSON] assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Deputy Registrar, consulted the applicants’ lawyer, the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and [DATE_TIME]). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received, on [DATE_TIME], the Government’s memorial and, on [DATE_TIME], the applicants’ observations. Various documents were produced by the Commission on [DATE_TIME] and by the Government on [DATE_TIME], at the request of the Registrar. On [DATE_TIME] the Registrar was informed that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the President - who had also given the Agent of the Government leave to plead in [NRP] (Rule 27 para. 2) - the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, [LOCATION], on [DATE_TIME]. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr [PERSON], Ministerialdirigent, Federal Ministry of Justice, Agent;\n\nfor the Commission Mr [PERSON], Delegate;\n\nfor the applicants [PERSON], Rechtsanwalt, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr [PERSON] for the Government, by Mr [PERSON] for the Commission and by Mr [PERSON] for the applicants, as well as replies to its questions and by two of its members individually.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nAt [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME], the first applicant, a social worker, drew up outside the back entrance to the block of flats in [LOCATION] where she lived. She was accompanied by her daughter [PERSON], who, at the time of the incident that gave rise to the complaint, was [DATE_TIME]. After she had opened the gate she was stopped by two police officers who had followed her and were standing in the gateway. They accused her of having driven through a red traffic light and of having tried to get away - an allegation denied by the applicant. The police officers claimed to have detected a strong smell of alcohol on her breath when they checked her driving licence. She agreed to be breathalysed. Despite having been shown what to do, she proved unable to provide a specimen of breath satisfactorily and was therefore told that she would have to accompany the police officers to the local hospital in order to have a blood test. An altercation followed during which [PERSON] was arrested. The precise course of the events is disputed by the applicants (see paragraph 7 below) and the police officers (see paragraph 9 below). She was then driven to the hospital for the blood test, which showed the level of alcohol in her blood to be 0.82 per ml (milligrammes per millilitre). She was subsequently released.\n\nAccording to the applicants, [PERSON] agreed to have a blood sample taken, but explained that she wished first to accompany her daughter to a neighbour. One of the police officers refused to allow this and dragged her to the police car. She was warned that she could be charged with obstructing a public officer in the execution of his duties (Widerstand gegen die [PERSON]). When she called her daughter, the police officers said that they would look after the child. Thereupon she took her daughter by the hand, went to the back door, rang her neighbour’s doorbell and opened the door. At that moment one of the police officers grabbed her, twisted her left arm behind her back and her head knocked against the corner of the window- ledge. The police officers then handcuffed her. She lost consciousness for a short while. When she came round, she found herself by the police car and noticed severe pain in her left shoulder, which was being pressed towards her back by one of the police officers. She was subsequently able to get into the police car and was driven to the hospital.\n\nThe first applicant underwent two medical examinations. On [DATE_TIME], [PERSON] certified that he had examined the applicant on [DATE_TIME] and noticed bruises which were about 10cm long on her right arm, considerable problems in moving her left shoulder, and bruises on that shoulder. He also stated that she would suffer long-term problems, in particular with her left shoulder. She was put on sick-leave until [DATE_TIME]. Furthermore, on [DATE_TIME], [PERSON], the chief surgeon at the local hospital, certified that he had examined the first applicant on [DATE_TIME] and had reached an almost identical diagnosis.\n\nI. THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED AGAINST THE FIRST APPLICANT\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], Police Constable (Polizeimeister) [PERSON] laid an information against the first applicant. She was charged with obstructing a public officer in the execution of his duties contrary to Article 113 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), and of driving while under the influence of alcohol contrary to Article 316 of the said code. Police Constable [PERSON] stated in his report that after [PERSON] had been informed that she had to undergo a blood test, she had attempted to escape into the darkness of the back-yard, whereupon he had grabbed her arm and stopped her. The applicant had been very aggressive. When informed that she was to be arrested, she had suddenly calmed down and declared that she would come along when she had taken her daughter, whom he had assumed to be [DATE_TIME], to a neighbour. The police officers had agreed in order to avoid a further escalation of the events. They had followed the applicants to the back door of the house. The first applicant had been about to follow her daughter into the house. She tried to close the door behind her but Police Constable Wildschut blocked the door open and Police Constable [PERSON] grabbed the first applicant’s right arm and pulled her outside. The child went upstairs. According to the report, [PERSON] struggled, struck out and tried to free herself from the police officer’s grip. Police Constable [PERSON] took her left arm and twisted it behind her back, whilst Police Constable [PERSON] kept a tight grip on her right arm. With great difficulty the officers managed to control the applicant, who was putting up a fight. They handcuffed her in order to avoid further criminal offences being committed, in particular injury to the person. On their way to the police car she had attempted to throw herself to the ground, and he and his colleague had had to hold her arms. At that point another police car arrived. However, by that time, the applicant’s neighbour had already offered to take care of the child. The officers noted on arrival at Lemgo Hospital that [PERSON] had a graze on her right temple.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the criminal proceedings against the first applicant were discontinued by the public prosecutor’s office (Staatsanwaltschaft) at the Detmold Regional Court (Landgericht) for two different reasons, namely that the offence of driving while under the influence of alcohol was not proven and that the applicant’s guilt in resisting the police officers had been minimal (gering) and there was no public interest in prosecuting. In [DATE_TIME] the competent administrative authority imposed an administrative fine of DM 500 for having committed the “regulatory offence“ ([PERSON]) of driving with a blood alcohol content level of 0.82 per ml when 0.80 per ml was the legal limit. A driving ban of [DATE_TIME] was also imposed. The Lemgo District Court ([PERSON]) confirmed this decision. The first applicant’s subsequent appeal to the Hamm Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) and to the Federal Constitutional Court ([PERSON]) were dismissed.\n\nII. PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY THE FIRST APPLICANT AGAINST THE POLICE OFFICERS\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the first applicant laid an information against the police officers concerned. She alleged that they had assaulted her contrary to Articles 223 and 230 of the Criminal Code. In her pleadings of [DATE_TIME], [PERSON] claimed that the police officers had used a disproportionate amount of force, causing injuries to her head, left shoulder and upper right arm. On [DATE_TIME], following a telephone conversation between her lawyer and an official of the public prosecutor’s office in which [PERSON]’ allegations were withdrawn - allegedly after a warning that criminal proceedings against her would otherwise be continued - the proceedings against the police officers were discontinued.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the first applicant filed a complaint ([NRP]) with the Head of the Detmold District Administration (Oberkreisdirektor) against the police officers involved in the arrest. She stated that she had wanted to wait for her neighbour to come to the door but that she had not been able to as the bearded police officer had twisted her arm behind her back and her head knocked against the brick window-ledge. Subsequently she was forcibly taken to the police car where she was held with her back up against the rear of the car. The bearded man continued to pull her left shoulder back at regular intervals. At some point she was dazed. She maintained that the blood test showed the level of alcohol to be 0.80 per ml. It was argued that the degree of force used against an unarmed woman was incomprehensible on an objective or subjective analysis; the mildest means of achieving the objective should have been employed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the Head of the Detmold District Administration, acting as the Police Department authority (Kreispolizeibehörde), dismissed her complaint. In the decision, it was stated in particular that after she had been informed that she would have to give a blood sample, she had attempted to run away. However, one of the police officers seized her arm and told her that she was under arrest. Her request to take her daughter to a neighbour’s first was granted. When the first applicant opened the door and tried to enter with her daughter, one of the police officers held her right arm fast, whereupon she started to kick and to hit out with her left hand. When the police officers held her tight she tried to escape. She had to be handcuffed. It was not accepted that her head knocked against the window-ledge at any moment in the course of the arrest. He concluded that the use of force had been justified and was not disproportionate to the aim pursued, namely the taking of a blood test.\n\nIII. THE FIRST APPLICANT’S PROCEEDINGS FOR COMPENSATION UNDER CIVIL LAW\n\nThe first applicant instituted civil proceedings in [DATE_TIME] against the Land North-Rhine Westphalia and the police officers concerned. She claimed compensation for the injuries sustained on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Detmold Regional Court, in a partial judgment, dismissed her complaint against the police officers on the ground that an official acting in the exercise of his duties does not incur personal liability.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Detmold Regional Court held a hearing in the case. The applicant’s neighbour was the first to give evidence. She said that she had noticed [PERSON] very blotchy and tear-stained face despite the dim light, had seen the blond police officer holding her arms behind her back and had feared that she would collapse at any moment as her knees had given way and she had bent forward suddenly several times. The neighbour stated on further questioning that, judging from the first applicant’s behaviour, she must have been in terrible pain. The first applicant complained about the pain in her left shoulder and asked the police officers to remove the handcuffs. This request was repeated by the neighbour but refused by the police officers. Police Constable [PERSON] confirmed the facts as set out in his report of [DATE_TIME] (see paragraph 9 above). He added that he was not sure whether the first applicant had deliberately not blown into the breathalyser for a sufficient time or whether she had had genuine difficulties. He stated that she had not knocked her head against the wall when she was pulled outside, however he remained unable to account for the injury to her right cheek to which he had referred in the aforementioned report. Upon further questioning he corroborated the neighbour’s evidence that [PERSON] had requested that the handcuffs be removed and he explained that they had refused this request as they had feared more trouble. He said that she had not complained about any pains in her shoulder and that she had certainly not knocked her head against the wall. However, he acknowledged that she did not have the head injury before they spoke to her and said that he did not know whether she had got the injury to her right cheek during the scuffle when the handcuffs had been put on. He could not remember who had kept hold of [PERSON] until they had put her into the police car, or whether she had bent forward suddenly owing, for instance, to a jerking on her handcuffs and the resulting pain. Police Constable Wildschut was the next to give evidence. He confirmed the general circumstances of the first applicant’s arrest as described by Police [PERSON], although he was not prepared to say that she had run away. After the applicant had opened the front door she had attempted to close it behind her but he had held on to it while his colleague kept a tight grip on her. As it was completely dark just outside the door he could not exclude the possibility that she could have knocked her head on the wall or on something else. In any event he did not notice it happening and it was only later that he became aware of her head injury. He stated that [PERSON] had vehemently resisted arrest which was why he had taken her left arm and twisted it behind her back and then handcuffed her arms in that position. He could not remember whether she had been handcuffed in the back-yard or whether they had first taken her to the street. He confirmed that she had requested that the handcuffs be removed but did not remember her complaining about any pain - in particular pain in her left shoulder. She continued, without success, to resist accompanying them, but he could not be sure who had been holding on to her while they waited for the second police car. On further questioning Police Constable Wildschut stated that he did not remember whether she had bent forward suddenly while she was still handcuffed. She had resisted arrest and had been lashing out when he had twisted her arm behind her back, but he assumed that she had not intended to assault either him or his colleague. He denied that he had pushed the first applicant’s head against the window-ledge. Finally, the second applicant, [PERSON], gave evidence. She stated that she remembered the incident with her mother and the police officers in their back-yard. She said, in particular, that her mother had rung the doorbell and opened the door using a key. [PERSON] had then gone into the house and closed the door behind her. She was not aware that one of the police officers had forcibly kept the door open. Having closed the door behind her, she said that she had managed to see through the plain glass door panel that one of the police officers had pushed her mother’s head against the wall. She emphasised that the police officer had repeatedly pushed her mother’s head against the wall next to the door using his hand. The officer concerned had blond hair. Her mother and the police officer had been close to the door, approximately one metre away from it. She herself had not been right in front of the glass panel. She had subsequently run upstairs to their neighbour. She further explained that, when her mother had rung the doorbell and opened the door, she had been standing to [PERSON]’s right. Her mother had opened the door only a little bit, and she had just been able to get in. She had then immediately closed the door behind her. Whilst she did not recognise the police officers involved she thought that the dark-haired police officer had a beard. She confirmed that the light had been poor, but said that it had been light in the staircase. She had not seen either of the police officers twisting her mother’s arm behind her back.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Detmold Regional Court dismissed the first applicant’s compensation claims against the Land North-Rhine Westphalia. It held as follows: “The plaintiff has no claim under Articles 839 and 847 of the Civil Code ([PERSON]) taken together with Article 34 of the Basic Law for breach of official duty to her on the part of Police [PERSON] and Wildschut. The Chamber is admittedly convinced that the plaintiff incurred the injuries complained of when she was arrested by the two police officers. In any event the plaintiff ended up with a graze on her temple, contusion of the left shoulder and probably also concussion, as was also confirmed in part by witnesses [PERSON] and [PERSON] and moreover does not seem to be seriously contested by the defendant Land. These injuries were probably sustained by the plaintiff in the context of her arrest. It does not follow, however, that the defendant Land is liable in damages. The arrest itself was not unlawful. Even if the plaintiff had no intention whatsoever to abscond, the situation nevertheless appeared otherwise to the police officers. The plaintiff was under suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, namely driving under the influence of alcohol in road traffic contrary to Article 316 of the Criminal Code, as the police officers had found that the plaintiff’s breath smelt of alcohol. On the basis of the credible statements of witnesses [PERSON] and [PERSON], the Chamber also assumes that the plaintiff’s conduct, first after failing to blow satisfactorily into the breathalyser and then later at the front door, gave both witnesses the impression that she intended to evade further investigation, namely the taking of a blood sample, by absconding. The Chamber can understand that the police officers could have foreseen very considerable difficulties if the plaintiff managed to get into the building without the two witnesses. First, the police officers could not know whether the plaintiff would have allowed them access to her flat at all. Secondly, the plaintiff would have had an opportunity of consuming more alcohol or at least claiming that she had done so, thereby making ascertainment of her blood alcohol level impossible or significantly more difficult to obtain. In the light of these circumstances the arrest does not appear to be disproportionate either, but a perfectly reasonable means of ensuring that the further investigations could be carried out. It is for the plaintiff to prove that in this initially lawful exercise of their duty the police officers went further than was necessary, by handling the plaintiff too roughly and in so doing injuring her or even by deliberately inflicting the injuries on her. Just as an attacker must prove that a person attacked by him, acting in self-defence, exceeded the limits of necessary self-defence (see Federal Court of Justice - Bundesgerichtshof -, [PERSON] [DATE_TIME], pp. 629 et seq.), so also, in the Chamber’s opinion, must this apply in a case such as the present one: a person who puts forward claims in respect of injuries suffered during a lawful arrest must prove that the police officers went beyond what was necessary and thereby caused the injuries. The plaintiff, however, has not succeeded in providing such proof. On the evidence which has been taken, the Chamber is not convinced that the police officers caused the plaintiff’s injuries by exceeding what was necessary when arresting her. With respect to the origin of the graze, the evidence of witness [PERSON], the plaintiff’s daughter, conflicts with that of witnesses [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Whereas witness [PERSON] claims to have seen one of the police officers repeatedly knocking the plaintiff’s head against the wall by the door, the two police officers deny this. None of these three witnesses can be regarded as not having an interest in these proceedings; the two police officers could certainly expect disciplinary proceedings and a resumption of the criminal investigation if these proved to be the facts, while witness [PERSON] has a natural interest in supporting her mother’s claim and account of the facts. It is not clear to the Chamber which of the statements corresponds to what really happened. Definite findings of fact can therefore not be made in this respect. The largely disinterested witness [PERSON] [the neighbour] was unable in her testimony to confirm the plaintiff’s assertion that witness [PERSON] had pulled her arms upwards while she was handcuffed. Neither can such a conclusion be drawn merely from the fact that according to witness [PERSON]’s statements the plaintiff leant forward jerkily several times while witness [PERSON] stood behind her. Neither the balance of probability nor general experience militate in favour of accepting the plaintiff’s version of events. The Chamber considers it by no means improbable that the plaintiff sustained all her injuries when she resisted being handcuffed. In the process her head could easily have knocked against the wall; the shoulder contusion could also have occurred when she struggled while being restrained by the police and when the handcuffs were being put on her. For these reasons the claim must be dismissed.“\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Hamm Court of Appeal dismissed the first applicant’s appeal. It upheld the decision of the Detmold Regional Court that [PERSON] had not proved that excessive force had been used against her by the police officers.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a panel of three judges of the Federal Constitutional Court declined to accept for adjudication the first applicant’s constitutional complaint on the ground that it did not offer sufficient prospects of success. It considered in particular that the Court of Appeal’s assessment of the evidence did not appear arbitrary or otherwise in violation of constitutional law. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nIn an application (no. 15473/89) lodged with the Commission on [DATE_TIME], [PERSON], the first applicant, submitted that, in the presence of her daughter, [PERSON], she had been subjected in the course of her arrest to inhuman and degrading treatment by the police contrary to Article 3 (art. 3) and that this treatment had violated her right guaranteed under Article 8 (art. 8) to respect for her private and family life. [PERSON], the second applicant, contended that the aforementioned treatment of her mother in her presence had violated her right to respect for her private and family life, contrary to Article 8 (art. 8), in addition to subjecting her to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Commission declared the applicants’ complaints admissible and in its report of [DATE_TIME] (Article 31) (art. 31), expressed the opinion: (a) by ten votes to five that there had been a violation of Article 3 (art. 3) in respect of the first applicant; (b) by ten votes to five that no separate issue had arisen under Article 8 (art. 8) in respect of the first applicant; (c) by fourteen votes to one that there had been no violation of Article 3 (art. 3) in respect of the second applicant; (d) by eight votes to seven that there had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) in respect of the second applicant. The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the various separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment. FINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nThe Government in their memorial of [DATE_TIME] invited the Court to find “that the applicants did not suffer violations of their rights under Article 3 (art. 3) or Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention“.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24254/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Tomasz Kwiatkowski (“the applicant”), on 24 June 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the lustration proceedings in his case had been unfair, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 8 October 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Konstancin‑Jeziorna.\n\nOn 11 April 1997 the parliament passed the Law on disclosing work for or service in the State’s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub służby w organach bezpieczeństwa państwa lub współpracy z nimi w latach 1944‑1990 osób pełniących funkcje publiczne; “the 1997 Lustration Act”). It entered into force on 3 August 1997. Persons falling under the provisions of the 1997 Lustration Act, i.e. candidates or holders of public office such as ministers and members of parliament, were required to declare whether or not they had worked for or collaborated with the security services during the communist regime. The provisions of the Act extended to, inter alia, judges, prosecutors and advocates.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant, who was an advocate, declared that he had not collaborated with the communist‑era secret services.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 2000 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant following a request made by the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) on the grounds that the applicant had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had co‑operated with the secret services.\n\nOn 27 June 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the first‑instance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration. The operative part of the judgment was served on the applicant. However, the reasoning was considered “secret” and, in accordance with Article 100 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, could only be consulted in the secret registry of that court.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal in which he maintained, in particular, that his rights had been breached because he could not freely consult the reasoning of the judgment.\n\nOn 16 May 2003 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the second‑instance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal as being manifestly ill‑founded. The applicant was removed from the Bar Association with the result that he is unable to practise as an advocate for a period of ten years in application of the 1997 Lustration Act.\n\nThe judgment was notified to the applicant’s representative on 17 January 2005.",

Elban and Ms Serpil Yalçın, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 11 December 2006 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Antalya.\n\nThe applicant owns a flat in Antalya. Based on a construction permit issued by the Antalya Municipality on 14 February 1991, construction works were commenced on neighbouring land to build an apartment block. The limitations concerning the height of the building were not respected and, as a result, the sea view from the applicant’s flat, which is situated on the sixth floor, was blocked by the new building.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the applicant initiated administrative proceedings against the Antalya Municipality for the annulment of the construction permit. He maintained that the permit was in breach of city planning regulations. On 27 June 1995 the Antalya Administrative Court found in the applicant’s favour and annulled the construction permit. On 13 March 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the Antalya Administrative Court.\n\nThe applicant asked the Antalya Municipality to enforce the decision of the Antalya Administrative Court, but his request was rejected.\n\nOn 18 October 1998 the applicant initiated compensation proceedings before the Antalya Administrative Court on account of the Municipality’s failure to implement the court order of 13 March 1996. He requested both pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensation, stating that the non-enforcement of the final court decision which had annulled the construction permit had diminished his flat’s value.\n\nOn 19 November 1998 the Antalya Administrative Court partially upheld the applicant’s claim, awarding him pecuniary compensation, but refusing non-pecuniary damages.\n\nOn 26 April 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Antalya Administrative Court’s decision in respect of pecuniary damage. However, finding that the applicant was also entitled to non-pecuniary compensation, it quashed the judgment in this respect. Subsequent to this decision, the Municipality paid the pecuniary compensation to the applicant.\n\nOn 1 November 2000 the Antalya Administrative Court awarded 250,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) to the applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\nOn 16 April 2002, considering the amount of non-pecuniary compensation insufficient, the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Antalya Administrative Court once again.\n\nOn 19 December 2002 the Antalya Administrative Court insisted on maintaining its judgment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 16 June 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Antalya Administrative Court of 19 December 2002.\n\nOn 29 December 2005 the Antalya Administrative Court adhered to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court and awarded the applicant TRL 1,000,000,000 in respect of non-pecuniary compensation with statutory interest running from 18 October 1996.\n\nOn 27 June 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal of the Municipality. The Municipality paid the due amount to the applicant.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nThe applicant owns a flat in [LOCATION]. Based on a construction permit issued by [LOCATION] on [DATE_TIME], construction works were commenced on neighbouring land to build an apartment block. The limitations concerning the height of the building were not respected and, as a result, the sea view from the applicant’s flat, which is situated on the sixth floor, was blocked by the new building.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the applicant initiated administrative proceedings against [LOCATION] for the annulment of the construction permit. He maintained that the permit was in breach of city planning regulations. On [DATE_TIME] the Antalya Administrative Court found in the applicant’s favour and annulled the construction permit. On [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the Antalya Administrative Court.\n\nThe applicant asked [LOCATION] to enforce the decision of the Antalya Administrative Court, but his request was rejected.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant initiated compensation proceedings before the Antalya Administrative Court on account of the Municipality’s failure to implement the court order of [DATE_TIME]. He requested both pecuniary and non-pecuniary compensation, stating that the non-enforcement of the final court decision which had annulled the construction permit had diminished his flat’s value.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Antalya Administrative Court partially upheld the applicant’s claim, awarding him pecuniary compensation, but refusing non-pecuniary damages.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Antalya Administrative Court’s decision in respect of pecuniary damage. However, finding that the applicant was also entitled to non-pecuniary compensation, it quashed the judgment in this respect. Subsequent to this decision, the Municipality paid the pecuniary compensation to the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Antalya Administrative Court awarded 250,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) to the applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], considering the amount of non-pecuniary compensation insufficient, the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Antalya Administrative Court once again.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Antalya Administrative Court insisted on maintaining its judgment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Antalya Administrative Court of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Antalya Administrative Court adhered to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court and awarded the applicant TRL 1,000,000,000 in respect of non-pecuniary compensation with statutory interest running from [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal of the Municipality. The Municipality paid the due amount to the applicant.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 48247/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Grzegorz Dublas (“the applicant”), on 10 November 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the length of his pre-trial detention and of criminal proceedings against him had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Articles 5 § 3 and 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 30 August 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaints concerning the length of the applicant’s pre‑trial detention and of his criminal proceedings to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3 of the Convention).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Pruszcz Gdański.\n\nOn 8 June 2004 he was arrested by the police.\n\nOn 9 June 2004 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to place the applicant in pre-trial detention as there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had been dealing in drugs. The court also cited the risk that the applicant would go into hiding, in view of the likelihood of a heavy sentence.\n\nOn 2 September and 4 November 2004 the applicant’s detention was extended. In addition to the two grounds given previously, the District Court cited the need to ensure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nOn 26 October 2004 the applicant was indicted before the Gdańsk District Court. His pre-trial detention was subsequently extended.\n\nAs the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory time‑limit of two years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the District Court made a series of applications to the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond that term. On 18 May and 17 August 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal granted the applications and extended his detention, citing the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and the length of the sentence that was likely to be imposed. The Court also considered that the District Court could not be held responsible for not having completed the trial as there had been objective procedural difficulties in hearing all the witnesses.\n\nThe first hearing was held on 21 January 2005. Subsequently, hearings were held at regular intervals.\n\nThe applicant’s applications for release from detention and his appeals against the decisions extending the preventive measure were dismissed.\n\nOn 17 October 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 20 November 2006. It cited the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and found that detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings given the likelihood of a heavy sentence.\n\nThe applicant’s detention on remand was not extended beyond that date and on 20 November 2006 he was released.\n\nOn 4 August 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). On 3 November 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the complaint, finding that the trial had been conducted speedily and with no periods of inactivity.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending before the trial court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 77746/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Waleria Kroenitz (“the applicant”), on 28 July 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The applicant was exceptionally granted leave to be represented by Mr Cz. Sławski (Rule 36 § 4 of the Rules of Court). The latter was also granted leave to use the Polish language in the proceedings before the Court (Rule 34 § 3 of the Rules of Court).\n\nThe applicant alleged in particular, that her right to a “hearing within reasonable time” had not been respected.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. On 30 April the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and an alleged interference with the applicant’s property rights to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. It also gave priority to application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant, Mrs Waleria Kroenitz, is a Polish national, who was born in 1903 and lives in Przemyśl, Poland.\n\nA. Proceedings concerning a claim for restitution and compensation.\n\nIn 1948 the applicant’s property was expropriated. On 28 June 1996 the Minister of Economy (Minister Gospodarki) annulled the expropriation order.\n\nOn 23 December 1996 the applicant brought a claim against a company “Domgos” (Częstochowskie Zakłady Metalowe “Domgos”) before the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki), seeking restitution of her property. The court held hearings on 30 May, 10 July and 17 October 1997.\n\nOn 30 January 1998 the applicant modified her claim and filed an action for compensation for loss of profits caused by the prolonged impossibility of using her property.\n\nOn 8 March 1999 the Częstochowa Regional Court held a hearing and gave an interlocutory judgment. It ordered that the property be restored to the applicant.\n\nOn 9 December 1999 the court was to hold a hearing, but an expert failed to appear because he had not been duly summoned. On 27 January 2000 and 23 March 2000 the court held further hearings.\n\nA hearing listed for 15 February 2001 was cancelled since the expert and the defendant failed to appear.\n\nThe hearing listed for 29 March 2001 was adjourned as the court had ordered the expert to prepare a supplementary report. On 21 February 2002 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 8 March 2002 the Regional Court gave judgment and awarded the applicant compensation. Following the defendant’s appeal, the proceedings are pending before the Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny).\n\nB. Proceedings concerning a claim for compensation against the State Treasury.\n\nOn 26 April 1998 the applicant asked the Minister of Economy to award her compensation. On 22 May 1998 the Minister dismissed her request.\n\nOn 24 June 1998 the applicant filed with the Warsaw Regional Court an action for compensation against the State Treasury the Minister of Economy. The court held hearings on 19 November 1999 and 22 September 2000.\n\nOn 22 September 2000 the court gave judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 24 January and 7 March 2002 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) held hearings. On the latter date the court gave judgment. The applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 27833/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Artur Nowak (“the applicant”), on 17 July 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms S. Jaczewska, and subsequently, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 5 June 2003 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland.\n\nIn December 1993 the applicant, at that time seventeen years old, was hit by a car driven by a certain Mr R.Z. As a consequence of the accident, his left leg had to be amputated.\n\nOn 17 June 1994 the applicant, represented by his mother, lodged with the Piotrków Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) a civil action against the State Insurance Company (Powszechny Zakład Ubezpieczeń). He claimed 800,000,000 old zlotys in compensation for pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damage.\n\nOn 18 June 1994 the trial court exempted the applicant from payment of court-fees.\n\nOn 24 August 1994 the first hearing was held. The trial court requested the applicant's medical file from a hospital and ordered an expert opinion.\n\nAt the next hearing held on 1 February 1995 the court heard an expert witness and requested a second expert opinion.\n\nBetween 2 February and 21 November 1995 no hearings were held.\n\nAt the hearing held on 22 November 1995 the trial court gave the parties a time-limit for reaching a friendly settlement.\n\nSubsequently, hearings were held on 11 March and 27 November 1996. At those hearings the court heard the applicant's mother and an expert witness.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 26 February 1997 was cancelled due to illness of the applicant's counsel.\n\nOn 27 February 1997 the applicant modified his claim. He in addition sought a monthly allowance.\n\nAfterwards, hearings were held on 5 March and 9 April 1997. Mr. R.Z., the driver responsible for the accident, joined the proceedings as an intervener.\n\nBetween 10 April 1997 and 10 September 1998 no hearings were held.\n\nOn 11 September and 9 October 1998 the trial court held hearings at which it heard an expert witness and the applicant.\n\nOn 2 December 1998 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court gave judgment. The trial court awarded the applicant compensation and a monthly pension.\n\nOn 28 January 1999 the defendant lodged an appeal against this judgment.\n\nOn 16 April 1999 the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) held a hearing and gave judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment regarding interest and ordered the applicant to reimburse the costs of the proceedings incurred by the defendant.\n\nOn 1 June 1999 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nOn 23 January 2002 the Supreme Court held a hearing and gave judgment. The Supreme Court partly allowed his cassation appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 17725/07) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Necmettin Alkan (“the applicant”), on 11 April 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms L. Alkan, his mother. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his right of access to court had been breached by the domestic court’s refusal to grant him legal aid.\n\nOn 25 May 2010 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Kars.\n\nOn 13 December 2002, after having completed his military service, the applicant was placed under the guardianship of his father, S.A., by a decision of the Sarıkamış Magistrates’ Court as he was mentally ill and needed constant supervision.\n\nThe applicant submitted several requests to the gendarmerie command claiming compensation for his illness which, according to him, began during his military service as a result of the treatment there. His requests were rejected on the basis of a medical report from the Gülhane Military Medical Academy, which indicated that such a condition could not have been caused merely by military service and that many other factors could have been involved in its development.\n\nSubsequently, under the guardianship of S.A., the applicant initiated compensation proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, claiming that his illness had been caused by the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected in the army. He argued that his enrolment for military service after having passed several medical tests was proof that he had been healthy before. The applicant requested a total of 200,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 100,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in respect of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, submitting the medical records from several hospitals in support of his claims. He also requested legal aid for the court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtar) attesting to his father’s poverty. The certificate stated that neither S.A. nor anyone else from his household was employed. It also indicated that he was ill, had no social security and depended on support from his neighbours.\n\nBy two decisions of 19 July and 1 November 2006 respectively, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s legal aid request, stating that pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, a legal aid request must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the plaintiff does not have the means to pay the required court fees. It concluded that the requirements had not been met in the applicant’s case.\n\nOn 6 November 2006 the court informed the applicant that he was to pay a total of TRY 2,719 (approximately EUR 1,400 at the time) in court fees within thirty days for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nOn 10 January 2007 the Supreme Military Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees.",

It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], after having completed his military service, the applicant was placed under the guardianship of his father, [LOCATION], by a decision of the Sarıkamış Magistrates’ Court as he was mentally ill and needed constant supervision.\n\nThe applicant submitted several requests to the gendarmerie command claiming compensation for his illness which, according to him, began during his military service as a result of the treatment there. His requests were rejected on the basis of a medical report from the Gülhane Military Medical Academy, which indicated that such a condition could not have been caused merely by military service and that many other factors could have been involved in its development.\n\nSubsequently, under the guardianship of [LOCATION], the applicant initiated compensation proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, claiming that his illness had been caused by the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected in the army. He argued that his enrolment for military service after having passed several medical tests was proof that he had been healthy before. The applicant requested a total of 200,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 100,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in respect of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, submitting the medical records from several hospitals in support of his claims. He also requested legal aid for the court fees, presenting a certificate from the office of the headman (muhtar) attesting to his father’s poverty. The certificate stated that neither [LOCATION] nor anyone else from his household was employed. It also indicated that he was ill, had no social security and depended on support from his neighbours.\n\nBy two decisions of [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] respectively, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s legal aid request, stating that pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, a legal aid request must be supported by proof that the case is well-founded and that the plaintiff does not have the means to pay the required court fees. It concluded that the requirements had not been met in the applicant’s case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court informed the applicant that he was to pay a total of TRY 2,719 (approximately EUR 1,400 at the time) in court fees within [DATE_TIME] for the proceedings to be continued.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Military Administrative Court decided to discontinue the compensation proceedings because the applicant had not paid the necessary court fees.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 71893/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Tadeusz Cegielski (“the applicant”), on 9 May 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 January 2003 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings and the alleged lack of effective remedy to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Bielsko-Biała, Poland.\n\nIn 1993 the Szczecin Regional Court annulled the decision given in 1947 by the Szczecin Military Court which had convicted the applicant’s father and had sentenced him to imprisonment and the forfeiture of his property.\n\nOn 25 September 1995 the Szczecin Regional Court (Criminal Chamber) awarded the applicant compensation for his father’s imprisonment.\n\nOn 20 July 1995 the applicant initiated before the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Wojwódzki w Szczecinie) civil proceedings against the State Treasury. He claimed compensation for the forfeited estate and farm machinery.\n\nOn 25 September 1995, upon the trial court’s request, the applicant called as defendant the State Treasury represented by the Bydgoszcz Regional Court.\n\nIn January 1996 the trial court requested the Criminal Chamber of the same court to provide the applicant’s case-file. It received the file in September 1996.\n\nOn 10 February 1999 the trial court held the first hearing at which it heard the applicant. It further decided that three witnesses would be heard by the Myslibórz District Court.\n\nOn 23 March and 13 April 1999 the Myslibórz District Court held hearings at which it heard the witnesses.\n\nOn 4 August 1999 the applicant applied to the trial court to give a partial judgment relating only to the pecuniary damage sustained by his father in respect of loss of income which, according to him, was fully justified by the provided documents.\n\nOn 14 February 2000 the trial court joined as a co-defendant the Minister of Finance. Three months later the trial court joined as another co‑defendant the Minister of the Treasury.\n\nOn 6 September 2000 the court held hearing at which it asked for an expert opinion concerning the value of the farm machinery.\n\nOn 8 May 2001 the expert opinion was submitted to the trial court.\n\nOn 18 May 2001 the court requested another expert opinion concerning the value of the land and buildings.\n\nOn 17 October 2001 the trial court held a hearing.\n\nOn 29 October 2001 the Szczecin Regional Court gave a partial judgment. It awarded the applicant PLN 21,105 as compensation for the confiscated machinery. The remaining part of the action was to be examined at the later date. The Minister of the Treasury appealed against this judgment.\n\nOn 21 May 2002 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed the Minister’s appeal against the Szczecin Regional Court’s partial judgment. The Minister of the Treasury lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. This part of the proceedings is pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe proceedings relating to the part of the applicant’s action which was not examined by the Szczecin Regional Court in its partial judgment, are still pending before the trial court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24203/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jarosław Kyzioł (“the applicant”), on 17 June 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 7 December 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Cracow. 1 Civil proceedings for dissolution of co-ownership\n\nOn 28 October 1994 a housing co-operative filed with the Cracow District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a claim for dissolution of co-ownership of five plots of land. The applicant is one of the co-owners of the land in question and has his family house there. There were 182 parties to the proceedings at the time when they were first instituted. This number has since increased to 417.\n\nOn 16 October 1997 the Cracow Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) decided to join the case in question to a related case involving a claim for the ascertainment of the ownership right to the same land, and to examine them together.\n\nOn 1 March 1999 the President of the Cracow District Court appointed an expert in geodesy. On 19 July 1999 the court admitted his expert report as evidence. On 1 July 2002 the President of the Cracow District Court requested that the original report be updated. The additional expert report was furnished in June 2003.\n\nOn 20 November and 18 December 2003 respectively the court decided to exclude two judges from dealing with the case. Moreover, on 18 December 2003 the Cracow District Court decided of its own motion to stay the proceedings due to the deaths of several of the parties, the need to ascertain the shares of their legal heirs and to summon new parties.\n\nOn 13 April 2006 the Cracow District Court resumed the proceedings since the successors of the deceased parties had been summoned to participate. However, in the same decision the court decided to stay the proceedings due to new circumstances, namely the deaths of other parties.\n\n2. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 15 December 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings under the Act of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn 14 February 2006 the Cracow Regional Court dismissed the complaint. The court held that the 2004 Act did not have retroactive effect and, consequently it examined the applicant’s claim only in respect of the period between the entry into force of the 2004 Act on 17 September 2004 and the date on which the complaint had been lodged by the applicant. The Cracow Regional Court found that the proceedings remained stayed due to the objective obstacle posed by the deaths of several of the parties and the delays caused by their legal heirs in submitting inheritance titles. The domestic court also emphasised that there was a considerable and ever-changing number of parties to the proceedings.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24203/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION]. 1 Civil proceedings for dissolution of co-ownership\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a housing co-operative filed with the Cracow District Court ([PERSON]) a claim for dissolution of co-ownership of five plots of land. The applicant is one of the co-owners of the land in question and has his family house there. There were 182 parties to the proceedings at the time when they were first instituted. This number has since increased to 417.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Cracow Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) decided to join the case in question to a related case involving a claim for the ascertainment of the ownership right to the same land, and to examine them together.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Cracow District Court appointed an expert in geodesy. On [DATE_TIME] the court admitted his expert report as evidence. On [DATE_TIME] the President of the Cracow District Court requested that the original report be updated. The additional expert report was furnished in [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] respectively the court decided to exclude two judges from dealing with the case. Moreover, on [DATE_TIME] the Cracow District Court decided of its own motion to stay the proceedings due to the deaths of several of the parties, the need to ascertain the shares of their legal heirs and to summon new parties.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Cracow District Court resumed the proceedings since the successors of the deceased parties had been summoned to participate. However, in the same decision the court decided to stay the proceedings due to new circumstances, namely the deaths of other parties.\n\n2. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings under the Act of [DATE_TIME] on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Cracow Regional Court dismissed the complaint. The court held that the 2004 Act did not have retroactive effect and, consequently it examined the applicant’s claim only in respect of the period between the entry into force of the 2004 Act on [DATE_TIME] and the date on which the complaint had been lodged by the applicant. The Cracow Regional Court found that the proceedings remained stayed due to the objective obstacle posed by the deaths of several of the parties and the delays caused by their legal heirs in submitting inheritance titles. The domestic court also emphasised that there was a considerable and ever-changing number of parties to the proceedings.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe cases originated in two applications (nos. 27080/08 and 40982/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Metin Köksal and Mr Servet Durdu (“the applicants”), on 29 May and 15 August 2008, respectively. The first applicant, Mr Köksal, was represented by Mr H. Çakıroğlu, a lawyer practising in Samsun. The second applicant, Mr Durdu, was represented by Mr M. Bayat, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were born in 1973 and 1965, respectively, and live in Samsun and Ankara.\n\nA. Application no. 27080/08\n\nOn 17 October 2001 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post following his previous criminal conviction by a martial law court. The conviction had been finalised by the Military Court of Cassation's decision of 11 November 1997.\n\nOn 4 January 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Samsun Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn 5 June 2002 the Samsun Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request.\n\nOn 7 February 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Samsun Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur (“tetkik hakimi”) concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 31 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for rectification of its previous decision.\n\nB. Application no. 40982/08\n\nOn 11 January 2002 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post after a disciplinary decision. Criminal proceedings were also commenced against the applicant on the same grounds as those which had led to his discharge.\n\nOn 15 March 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Ankara Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn 25 June 2002 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the offences with which he had been charged. On 22 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's acquittal.\n\nIn the meantime, on 31 March 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court refused the applicant's request to annul the discharge order. Relying on Section 131 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law no. 657), the administrative court held that the applicant's acquittal of the criminal charges did not absolve him from the disciplinary sanction.\n\nOn 26 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 23 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's rectification request. The final decision was served on the applicant on 4 March 2008.",

The first applicant, Mr [PERSON], was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [PERSON]. The second applicant, Mr [PERSON], was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe applicants were born in [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], respectively, and live in [LOCATION] and [LOCATION].\n\nA. Application no. 27080/08\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was discharged from his civil service post following his previous criminal conviction by a martial law court. The conviction had been finalised by the Military Court of Cassation's decision of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant brought an action before the Samsun Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Samsun Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Samsun Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur (“tetkik hakimi”) concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for rectification of its previous decision.\n\nB. Application no. 40982/08\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was discharged from his civil service post after a disciplinary decision. Criminal proceedings were also commenced against the applicant on the same grounds as those which had led to his discharge.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant brought an action before the Ankara Administrative Court to annul the discharge order.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the offences with which he had been charged. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's acquittal.\n\nIn the meantime, on [DATE_TIME] the Ankara Administrative Court refused the applicant's request to annul the discharge order. Relying on Section 131 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law no. 657), the administrative court held that the applicant's acquittal of the criminal charges did not absolve him from the disciplinary sanction.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's rectification request. The final decision was served on the applicant on [DATE_TIME].",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 47551/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Aniela Leszczyńska (“the applicant”), on 23 February 1998.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and Mr. J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 10 July 2001 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Włocławek, Poland.\n\nA. Proceedings concerning dissolution of co-ownership.\n\nThe applicant and her neighbours were the co-owners of real estate located in Włocławek. On 28 June 1982 the applicant filed an action with the Włocławek District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) in which she requested that the co-ownership of the estate be dissolved.\n\nPrior to 19 September 1989 the court held a number of hearings and two viewings of the site. It also obtained two expert reports.\n\nOn 19 September 1989 the District Court gave a decision. The neighbours (“the respondents”) appealed. On 5 July 1991 the Włocławek Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) set aside the first-instance decision and remitted the case.\n\nOn 20 December 1991 the District Court held a hearing. On 17 November 1992 the court obtained another expert’s opinion.\n\nA hearing listed for 16 June 1993 was adjourned due to the absence of the respondents’ lawyer. On 3 August 1993 the court held a hearing and heard evidence from an expert.\n\nThe court held a further hearing on 29 April 1994. It ordered yet another expert to prepare an opinion. On 7 October 1994 the court held a viewing of the site. On 17 November 1994 a hearing was held. At a hearing held on 13 April 1995 the court heard evidence from an expert.\n\nOn 27 April 1995 the Włocławek District Court gave a decision and dissolved the co-ownership. The respondents appealed.\n\nOn 20 July 1995 the District Court refused to exempt the respondents from the court fees due for lodging the appeal. On 22 August 1995 they appealed against this decision and requested the court to grant them leave to appeal out of time. On 19 December 1995 the court granted them that leave. On 15 April 1996 the Włocławek Regional Court amended the decision of 20 July 1995 and partially exempted the respondents from the court fees.\n\nOn 12 September 1996 the Włocławek Regional Court dismissed the respondents’ appeal. On 18 December 1996, they lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On 3 September 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal.\n\nB. Proceedings concerning the action for repossession.\n\nOn 21 September 1996 the applicant filed an action for repossession of part of the property with the Włocławek District Court. She claimed that the court in its decision of 27 April 1995 (given in the first set of proceedings), had not ordered the respondents to surrender part of the property in question to her.\n\nOn 14 April 1997 the court stayed the proceedings, considering that the determination of the case depended on the outcome of the proceedings pending before the Supreme Court. On 5 January 1998 the proceedings were resumed.\n\nOn 28 January 1998 the trial court held a hearing. On 14 March 1998 an expert opinion was submitted to the court.\n\nOn 21 April 1998 the Włocławek District Court gave judgment and granted the applicant’s claim. The defendants appealed. On 8 October 1998 the Włocławek Regional Court dismissed their appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35656/97) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Jadwiga Hulewicz (“the applicant”), on 10 June 1996.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs M. Zawitkowska, a lawyer practising in Słupsk, Poland. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr K. Drzewicki and subsequently Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that her case had not been heard within a reasonable time in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 12 November 2002 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a Polish national who was born in 1952 and lives in Lębork, Poland.\n\nOn 23 May 1990 the applicant acquired the right to a long-term lease of a flat (spółdzielcze lokatorskie prawo do lokalu) in a building owned by the Lębork Housing Co-operative (Spółdzielnia Mieszkaniowa).\n\nOn 22 July 1993 the co-operative sued the applicant in the Lębork District Court (Sąd Rejonowy), seeking payment. On 25 October 1993 the court gave judgment and granted the claim. The applicant appealed against this judgment. On 19 January 1994 the Słupsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) amended the first-instance judgment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant twice requested the Minister of Justice to grant her leave to file an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). Her first request was rejected on 10 October 1994.\n\nOn 31 January 1997, upon the applicant’s second request, the Minister of Justice filed a cassation appeal on the applicant’s behalf, contesting the judgment of the Słupsk Regional Court of 19 January 1994.\n\nOn 29 April 1997 the Supreme Court quashed both judgments given in the applicant’s case and remitted the case to the court of first instance. It held that the lower courts had committed serious errors of fact and law.\n\nOn 28 October 1997 the Lębork District Court joined the applicant’s case with similar proceedings against seven other members of the co‑operative.\n\nOn 19 March 1998 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 8 May 1998 the court ordered that expert evidence be obtained.\n\nOn 9 June 1998 the court exempted the applicant from half of the court fees due. The applicant appealed. On 29 December 1998 the Słupsk Regional Court rejected her appeal.\n\nOn 29 February 2000 the trial court ordered that further expert evidence be obtained. On 19 May 2000 the expert submitted his report to the court. On 4 October 2000 the applicant challenged the expert’s opinion of 19 May 2000.\n\nOn 5 October 2000 the court held a hearing and listed the next hearing for 17 October 2000.\n\nOn 1 March 2002 the District Court gave judgment. On 8 April 2002 the applicant appealed against this judgment.\n\nIt appears that the proceedings are pending.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35656/97) against [LOCATION] lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION], [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr [PERSON] and subsequently Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that her case had not been heard within a reasonable time in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to [LOCATION] of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a [NRP] national who was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant acquired the right to a long-term lease of a flat (spółdzielcze lokatorskie prawo do lokalu) in a building owned by the Lębork Housing Co-operative ([PERSON]).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the co-operative sued the applicant in the Lębork District Court ([PERSON]), seeking payment. On [DATE_TIME] the court gave judgment and granted the claim. The applicant appealed against this judgment. On [DATE_TIME] the Słupsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) amended the first-instance judgment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant twice requested the Minister of Justice to grant her leave to file an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). Her first request was rejected on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], upon the applicant’s second request, the Minister of Justice filed a cassation appeal on the applicant’s behalf, contesting the judgment of the Słupsk Regional Court of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court quashed both judgments given in the applicant’s case and remitted the case to the court of first instance. It held that the lower courts had committed serious errors of fact and law.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lębork District Court joined the applicant’s case with similar proceedings against seven other members of the co‑operative.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court held a hearing.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court ordered that expert evidence be obtained.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court exempted the applicant from half of the court fees due. The applicant appealed. On [DATE_TIME] the Słupsk Regional Court rejected her appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court ordered that further expert evidence be obtained. On [DATE_TIME] the expert submitted his report to the court. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant challenged the expert’s opinion of [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court held a hearing and listed the next hearing for [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court gave judgment. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed against this judgment.\n\nIt appears that the proceedings are pending.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35302/08) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by five Turkish nationals, Mr Ali Ayboğa, Mr Abdurrezzak Ayboğa, Mr Abdülcebbar Ayboğa, Mr Salih Ayboğa and Mr Dergah Bitkin (“the applicants”), on 23 June 2008.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Ms Z. Değirmenci and Ms E. Sayın, lawyers practising in İzmir. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 16 March 2010 the application was declared partially inadmissible and the complaint concerning the applicants’ right to have effective review proceedings, by which they could challenge the lawfulness of their continued detention, was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1947, 1976, 1973, 1983 and 1987 respectively. At the time of the application they were being held in detention in Buca F‑Type prison in İzmir.\n\nOn 23 July 2007 the İzmir Assize Court decided to restrict access to the investigation file, under Article 153 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the “CCP”), Law no. 5271.\n\nOn 24 July 2007 the applicants were arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of being members of a criminal organisation.\n\nOn 27 July 2007 the applicants were questioned by the investigating judge, in the presence of their lawyer. According to their statements to the judge, the applicants denied being involved with the criminal organisation. They did not deny that they had had telephone conversations that had been intercepted, or that they had accepted the transfer of parcels and had possessed firearms, all of which were deemed to be evidence of making threats, of fraud and of smuggling, the offences that they were suspected of having committed.\n\nOn 1 August 2007 the applicants’ representative objected to the order for the pre‑trial detention in respect of the first four applicants. The representative also applied for their release pending trial on 3 February 2008, 11 February 2008 and 13 February 2008 respectively. Those applications were dismissed by the İzmir Assize Court on 4 February 2008, 11 February 2008 and 14 February 2008 respectively based the nature of the criminal charges and the state of the evidence. No hearing was held.\n\nOn 13 March 2008 the public prosecutor at the İzmir Assize Court filed an indictment, charging the first applicant with establishing a criminal organisation and the other applicants with being members of a criminal organisation. The applicants were further charged with committing fraud, making threats, and carrying out raids and smuggling, under Article 220 and other related articles of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 17 March 2008 the trial court held an interlocutory session and, in the absence of the applicants, decided to extend their pre-trial detention. The first hearing was scheduled for 24 June 2008.\n\nOn 2 May 2008 the applicants’ representative objected to that decision in respect of the first four applicants and applied for them to be released. On 7 May 2008 the İzmir Assize Court dismissed the objection. The applicants’ representative appealed. On 9 May 2008 the appeal court dismissed the appeal without holding an oral hearing.\n\nOn 24 June 2008 İzmir Assize Court held the first hearing as planned and the applicants appeared before the court. The trial court decided to release the applicants from pre-trial detention on the same day.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 16608/09) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Andrej Furman (“the applicant”), on 23 March 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr P. Čeh, a lawyer practising in Maribor. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs B. Jovin Hrastnik, State Attorney. The Austrian Government were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been unable to enjoy family life with his daughter on account of the lack of diligence on the part of the Slovenian and Austrian authorities in regulating and enforcing contact between them.\n\nOn 3 July 2012 the application was communicated to the Governments.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Maribor. From 1991 to 1997 he lived with M.P. in an extramarital relationship. On 14 December 1993 the latter gave birth to their daughter, P.\n\nIn 1997 the applicant and M.P. separated and, with the assistance of the Maribor Social Work Centre (hereinafter “the Centre”), concluded an agreement determining the amount of child maintenance to be paid by the applicant for his daughter. Another agreement was concluded on 23 February 1998 setting up a provisional contact schedule governing the applicant’s contact with P. for the period from 24 February to 13 April 1998.\n\nA. Contact proceedings before the Slovenian authorities and the enforcement of the relevant decisions\n\nHaving been unable to come to an agreement with M.P. as to a more permanent contact schedule, on 24 February 1998 the applicant asked the Centre to issue an order determining his contact rights. He sought contact with P. every Tuesday afternoon, every second Thursday afternoon, every other weekend, one week during the winter holiday and one month during the summer holiday.\n\nIt appears that, as of 13 April 1998, M.P. stopped letting the applicant have contact with P.\n\nThe first hearing in the case was scheduled for 18 June 1998 and subsequently adjourned at the request of M.P., who informed the Centre that she was taking holiday during the period in question.\n\nOn 14 June 1998 M.P. sent another letter to the Centre informing them that she would be living abroad in the period between 1 July 1998 and 31 August 1999 for the purposes of her doctoral studies. She requested that the contact proceedings be suspended during that period.\n\nFurther to the applicant’s objection to M.P.’s request for the suspension of the proceedings, the Centre’s social workers paid three visits to M.P.’s address in Maribor in order to establish whether she was still living in Slovenia. However, M.P. was not found at home on either occasion.\n\nOn 30 July 1998 the Centre sent a request to M.P.’s employer, Maribor University, to provide the address of her foreign residence.\n\nOn 26 August 1998 the applicant sought an interim order granting him contact with P.\n\nOn 4 September 1998 the Centre received a reply from Maribor University stating that M.P. was studying in Graz, Austria, but that they were unaware of her address. However, the university offered to serve M.P. with the summons to attend a hearing. The Centre scheduled a hearing for 22 October 1998, but the university was unable to reach M.P. and the hearing was adjourned.\n\nOn 29 October 1998 the Centre issued an interim order setting up a provisional contact schedule between the applicant and P. According to the order, the applicant was to have contact with P. once a month and for a week during both the winter and summer holidays. The applicant was supposed to pick up his daughter at M.P.’s permanent address in Maribor and bring her back to the same address.\n\nAnother hearing was scheduled for 10 December 1998 and subsequently adjourned, as the university was again unable to serve M.P. with the summons.\n\nOn 12 January 1999 Maribor University provided the Centre with the address of the Austrian university where M.P. was studying. The Centre thus sent the interim order of 29 October 1998 and a summons for a hearing scheduled for 11 February 1999 to M.P. at the address of that institution.\n\nOn 24 February 1999 M.P. appealed against the interim order of 29 October 1998, arguing that the provisional contact schedule could not be implemented, as she and her daughter were temporarily living in Graz, Austria.\n\nOn 1 March 1999 the Centre rejected M.P.’s appeal as out of time, whereupon she appealed to the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs (hereinafter “the Ministry”).\n\nOn 28 April and 18 June 1999 the Centre submitted the applicant’s requests for the enforcement of the interim order to the Maribor Administrative Unit. On 24 August 1999 the requests were granted; however, on 16 September 1999 M.P. appealed, claiming that the decision had not been correctly served on her. She also objected to the contents of the interim order.\n\nOn 27 September 1999 the Ministry upheld M.P.’s appeal against the interim order, quashed the order and remitted the issue of the provisional contact schedule for a fresh examination by the Centre. The Ministry found that the service of the interim order and the summons to the hearing of 11 February 1999 had not been effected in accordance with the rules of administrative procedure. The Ministry pointed out that in the event that a party was absent or lived abroad, he or she had to be invited to appoint a representative authorised to receive his or her official mail. As to the merits of the matter, the Ministry found that the facts of the case had not been duly established, owing to the difficulty of communicating with M.P.\n\nOn 7 October 1999 the Centre sent the Ministry’s decision, along with a request to M.P. to appoint a representative authorised to receive her official mail, to the Slovenian Embassy in Austria. The Embassy requested M.P. to collect the decision and the letter; however, she refused to do so. Subsequently, on 1 March 2000, M.P. was served with the documents at her workplace in Graz.\n\nMeanwhile, on 5 January 2000 the Ministry also upheld M.P.’s appeal against the decision on the enforcement of the interim order. The case was remitted to the Maribor Administrative Unit and the enforcement proceedings were subsequently stayed as a result of the quashing of the interim order.\n\nOn 15 March 2000 M.P. informed the Centre of the address of her representative authorised to receive her official mail.\n\nOn 6 June 2000 M.P. submitted a proposal regarding the contact schedule between the applicant and P., and on 12 June 2000 the applicant made a counter-proposal. On 30 June 2000 the Centre invited M.P. to provide certain information regarding her daughter’s residence, living conditions and education. On 19 July 2000 M.P. sent a reply to the Centre, without, however, providing the requested information on P. On 21 July 2000 the Centre again invited M.P. to provide the information, to which she responded on 14 August 2000, but again failed to provide answers to the Centre’s questions.\n\nOn 29 September 2000 the Centre held a hearing in the applicant’s presence. M.P., however, did not attend, although a summons had been correctly served on her authorised representative. The applicant reiterated his request for the setting up of a contact schedule between him and P.\n\nOn 5 October 2000 the Centre issued an order granting the applicant contact with P. every Tuesday afternoon, every first weekend of the month and a few weeks during the winter and summer holiday periods. According to the order, an appeal against the contact schedule would not have a suspensive effect.\n\nOn 22 November 2000 M.P. appealed against the order before the Ministry.\n\nOn 4 and 28 December 2001 and on 23 January 2002 the applicant requested that the contact schedule be enforced.\n\nOn 13 March 2002 the Maribor administrative unit rejected the applicant’s request for enforcement, stating that the order of 5 October 2000 was unenforceable as the Centre had failed to specify the place at which the applicant was to pick up and drop off his daughter. Subsequently, on 10 June 2002 the Centre informed the applicant that the order could not be supplemented with the required information, as M.P.’s appeal against it was pending before the Ministry.\n\nOn 19 July 2002 the Ministry upheld M.P.’s appeal against the order of 5 October 2000, confirming the reasoning of the administrative unit that the order was unenforceable. Moreover, the facts of the case had still not been properly established. The case was remitted to the Centre with the instruction to acquire information on M.P.’s and P.’s place of residence, P.’s schooling and her afternoon activities.\n\nOn 30 September 2002 the Centre invited M.P. to provide them with the information requested by the Ministry in their decision of 19 July 2002. She did not reply.\n\nOn 27 February 2003 the Centre contacted the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with a view to finding the address of M.P. and P. On 7 May 2003 the Centre was informed that the Slovenian Embassy in Austria had been unable to obtain such information.\n\nOn 16 May 2003 the Centre addressed a request for assistance in obtaining the information on M.P.’s and P.’s address to the Ministry. As no reply was received, the Centre requested assistance again on 28 May 2004.\n\nFurther to legislative changes by which on 1 May 2004 the courts acquired jurisdiction to decide on issues relating to rights of contact, in June 2004 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Maribor District Court. At the District Court’s request, the applicant supplemented his application on 3 August 2004.\n\nThe Maribor District Court scheduled a hearing for 6 October 2004; however, M.P. was unable to attend and only the applicant appeared in court. He complained that M.P. was in the habit of evading the proceedings and that, as a result, he had not seen P. for six years.\n\nOn 5 January 2005 M.P. informed the Maribor District Court that she and P. had not resided at their Slovenian address for a number of years and that she had kept that address only for the purpose of receiving mail. However, she failed to provide her address in Austria. M.P. proposed that the Slovenian courts relinquish their jurisdiction in the matter in favour of the Austrian courts.\n\nOn 13 July 2005 the applicant sent a letter to the Graz Youth and Family Office asking them for help in re-establishing contact with P. He explained that M.P. had been preventing him from having contact with his daughter and had evaded the proceedings conducted by the Centre and the Maribor District Court. He also attached a letter he had written to P., with photos of him and his family. The applicant’s letter was handed over to M.P. by a social worker on 6 October 2005.\n\nThe Maribor District Court scheduled another hearing for 14 November 2005, but since M.P. had not been served with a summons to attend, the hearing was adjourned. Scheduling further hearings, on 2 November 2005 the Maribor District Court asked the Graz District Court for Civil Matters to serve a summons on M.P. in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. The court also attempted to serve the document on M.P. through the Slovenian Embassy in Austria. However, its attempt was unsuccessful; both the embassy and, on 12 January 2006, the Graz District Court for Civil Matters notified the Maribor District Court that M.P. did not appear to be living at the indicated address. The Maribor District Court continued sending mail to M.P.’s address in Maribor.\n\nOn 13 December 2005 the Maribor District Court again asked the Graz District Court for Civil Matters to serve a summons on M.P. in Austria. The mail was delivered to her at the Graz District Court for Civil Matters on 7 March 2006, after the Graz court had obtained information on M.P.’s address from the Registration Office and two unsuccessful attempts had been made to serve the summons at her home address.\n\nMeanwhile, on 9 December 2005 the Maribor District Court requested the Graz District Court for Civil Matters to obtain a report on P.’s situation from the Graz Youth and Family Office. It appears that the request was sent to the Austrian court on 23 March 2006 and received by the District Court for Civil Matters on 29 March 2006. The latter submitted it to the Youth and Family Office on 30 March 2006. The social worker in charge of the case requested three times to meet with M.P. and P. in order to prepare the report, but without success. It appears that M.P. did not attend the first two meetings for work-related reasons. On the last occasion M.P. replied that she and her daughter would be spending the next few months abroad. On 7 July 2006 the Graz Youth and Family Office reported back that M.P. had refused to cooperate. A further request for a report was submitted on 28 September 2006. On 20 October 2006 the Youth and Family Office notified the District Court for Civil Matters that M.P. could not be reached because she was abroad at the time. On 15 November 2006 the latter court sent a reply to the Maribor District Court, which received it on 4 December 2006.\n\nOn 7 February 2007 the Maribor District Court held a hearing and on the same day issued an order setting out a contact schedule. M.P. did not attend the hearing; however, she informed the court that P. did not wish to have contact with the applicant. The court ruled that the applicant could visit P. every two weeks by picking her up at M.P.’s home. The court found that there were no objective reasons for P. to refuse contact with her father and that she had been influenced by M.P.’s negative attitude towards the applicant. It also criticised M.P.’s conduct and her “uncooperative attitude”.\n\nM.P. appealed against the contact order.\n\nOn 5 July 2007, on the applicant’s proposal, the Maribor District Court issued an enforceable interim order allowing him contact with P. every two weeks, whereby once a month he was to visit her at her address in Austria and the other time P. was to visit him in Slovenia. Following an objection on the part of M.P. in which she stated that she was unwilling to take P. to Slovenia, on 21 January 2008 the Maribor District Court modified the interim order so that visits could take place only in Graz. M.P. was ordered to comply with the terms of the order, subject to a fine of 200 euros (EUR) for each breach.\n\nOn 1 September 2007 the applicant saw P. for the first time in more than nine years. They had contact again on 6 October 2007. On the latter occasion, P. left after less than an hour, after which she refused to see the applicant again, although he attempted to see her on at least two more occasions.\n\nOn 15 May 2008 the Maribor Higher Court dismissed an appeal lodged by M.P. against the contact order of 7 February 2007. Consequently, the order became final.\n\nMeanwhile from April to June 2008, the applicant requested five times that a fine be imposed on M.P. for failure to comply with the interim contact order (3 April 2008, 15 April 2008, 23 April 2008, 16 May 2008 and 11 June 2008).\n\nOn 12 June 2008 the applicant requested for the sixth time that a fine be imposed on M.P. On 11 September 2008, the Maribor District Court explained to the parties that the contact proceedings had been concluded by a final decision and the Maribor Local Court was competent to decide on the enforcement of the contact order. The District Court referred the applicant’s further request for enforcement of 3 October 2008 to the Local Court. Subsequently, the applicant lodged another three requests for enforcement on 29 December 2008, 25 March 2009 and 27 March 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, on 10 February 2009, the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal under the Right to Trial without Undue Delay Act (hereinafter “the 2006 Act”) with a view to accelerating the enforcement proceedings.\n\nOn 3 March 2009, the Maribor Local Court imposed a fine in the amount of EUR 600 on M.P. for not complying with the contact order. On 4 March 2009 the President of the Maribor Local Court, in the context of the proceedings in respect of the 2006 Act, informed the applicant of the decision taken the day before. On 1 April 2009 the applicant replied that none of his other requests had yet been resolved.\n\nM.P. having appealed against the fine, on 28 July 2009 the Maribor Higher Court set aside the impugned order, stating that a deadline should have first been set for M.P. to comply with the contact order. On 23 April 2010 the Maribor Local Court invited the applicant to supplement his request for enforcement. On the basis of that request, a new enforcement order was issued on 2 November 2010, ordering M.P. to allow contact between the applicant and P., subject to a fine in the amount of EUR 500. M.P. appealed against the order.\n\nOn 4 September 2012 the Maribor Local Court quashed all the enforcement acts executed until that date and dismissed the applicant’s request for enforcement, finding that since the contact between the applicant and P. was to take place in Austria, the Austrian courts had jurisdiction to decide on the enforcement.\n\nB. Suspension of the applicant’s contact rights by the Austrian authorities\n\nOn 30 September 2008 P. lodged a request with the Graz-West District Court seeking suspension of the applicant’s contact rights.\n\nOn 11 November 2008 P. gave a statement before the District Court, alleging that throughout the period in which she had been living in Austria the applicant had not wished to have any contact with her and had made no attempts to see her. She further maintained that he had not obtained a court order setting out a contact schedule until 2007. Two visits had been carried out. However, since he had been criticising M.P., she had refused to have any further contact with him, and she had repeatedly told him so. P. also said that she had no relationship with her father and that she was afraid that he would take her to Slovenia.\n\nThe applicant made a statement before the Maribor District Court on the basis of a letter rogatory submitted by the Austrian authorities. On 27 March 2009 the Graz-West District Court suspended his contact rights. It found that P. had consistently expressed her wish not to have contact with the applicant and concluded that contact against her wishes would not be in her interest. The court also found that M.P. had not obstructed contact and that the applicant had stated in the proceedings that he would respect P.’s wish not to have contact with him.\n\nOn 31 August 2009 the Graz Regional Civil Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant, finding that there was no indication that P. had been manipulated by M.P. or was not expressing her wishes freely.\n\nC. Proceedings concerning monthly child maintenance conducted before the Austrian authorities\n\nOn 21 June 2008 M.P. asked the Graz-West District Court to increase the monthly child maintenance from EUR 137 to EUR 250 on the grounds that P.’s needs, as well as the general cost of living, had increased since 1997 when she and the applicant had concluded the maintenance agreement.\n\nOn 12 February 2009 the court, taking into account the financial situation of both parents, allowed M.P.’s request.\n\nAn appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the Graz District Court for Civil Matters on 7 August 2009.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the applicant sent a number of letters to the courts in Graz complaining that the court documents were in German, which he did not understand, and requesting that the issue be decided by the Slovenian authorities.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 16608/09) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON], State Attorney. The Austrian Government were represented by their Agent, Ambassador [PERSON], Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been unable to enjoy family life with his daughter on account of the lack of diligence on the part of the [NRP] and [NRP] authorities in regulating and enforcing contact between them.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the application was communicated to the Governments.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION]. From [DATE_TIME] he lived with [LOCATION] in an extramarital relationship. On [DATE_TIME] the latter gave birth to their daughter, P.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the applicant and M.P. separated and, with the assistance of the Maribor Social Work Centre (hereinafter “the Centre”), concluded an agreement determining the amount of child maintenance to be paid by the applicant for his daughter. Another agreement was concluded on [DATE_TIME] setting up a provisional contact schedule governing the applicant’s contact with P. for the period from [DATE_TIME].\n\nA. Contact proceedings before the [NRP] authorities and the enforcement of the relevant decisions\n\nHaving been unable to come to an agreement with M.P. as to a more permanent contact schedule, on [DATE_TIME] the applicant asked the Centre to issue an order determining his contact rights. He sought contact with P. every [DATE_TIME], every second [DATE_TIME], every other weekend, [DATE_TIME] during the winter holiday and one month during [DATE_TIME].\n\nIt appears that, as of [DATE_TIME], M.P. stopped letting the applicant have contact with P.\n\nThe first hearing in the case was scheduled for [DATE_TIME] and subsequently adjourned at the request of M.P., who informed the Centre that she was taking holiday during the period in question.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. sent another letter to the Centre informing them that she would be living abroad in the period [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] for the purposes of her doctoral studies. She requested that the contact proceedings be suspended during that period.\n\nFurther to the applicant’s objection to M.P.’s request for the suspension of the proceedings, the Centre’s social workers paid three visits to M.P.’s address in [LOCATION] in order to establish whether she was still living in [LOCATION]. However, M.P. was not found at home on either occasion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre sent a request to M.P.’s employer, Maribor University, to provide the address of her foreign residence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant sought an interim order granting him contact with P.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre received a reply from Maribor University stating that M.P. was studying in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], but that they were unaware of her address. However, the university offered to serve M.P. with the summons to attend a hearing. The Centre scheduled a hearing for [DATE_TIME], but the university was unable to reach [LOCATION] and the hearing was adjourned.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre issued an interim order setting up a provisional contact schedule between the applicant and P. According to the order, the applicant was to have contact with P. once a month and for [DATE_TIME] during both the winter and [DATE_TIME]. The applicant was supposed to pick up his daughter at M.P.’s permanent address in [LOCATION] and bring her back to the same address.\n\nAnother hearing was scheduled for [DATE_TIME] and subsequently adjourned, as the university was again unable to serve M.P. with the summons.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Maribor University provided the Centre with the address of the [NRP] university where M.P. was studying. The Centre thus sent the interim order of [DATE_TIME] and a summons for a hearing scheduled for [DATE_TIME] to [LOCATION] at the address of that institution.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. appealed against the interim order of [DATE_TIME], arguing that the provisional contact schedule could not be implemented, as she and her daughter were temporarily living in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre rejected M.P.’s appeal as out of time, whereupon she appealed to the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs (hereinafter “the Ministry”).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre submitted the applicant’s requests for the enforcement of the interim order to the Maribor Administrative Unit. On [DATE_TIME] the requests were granted; however, on [DATE_TIME] M.P. appealed, claiming that the decision had not been correctly served on her. She also objected to the contents of the interim order.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ministry upheld M.P.’s appeal against the interim order, quashed the order and remitted the issue of the provisional contact schedule for a fresh examination by the Centre. The Ministry found that the service of the interim order and the summons to the hearing of [DATE_TIME] had not been effected in accordance with the rules of administrative procedure. The Ministry pointed out that in the event that a party was absent or lived abroad, he or she had to be invited to appoint a representative authorised to receive his or her official mail. As to the merits of the matter, the Ministry found that the facts of the case had not been duly established, owing to the difficulty of communicating with M.P.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre sent the Ministry’s decision, along with a request to M.P. to appoint a representative authorised to receive her official mail, to the Slovenian Embassy in [LOCATION]. The Embassy requested M.P. to collect the decision and the letter; however, she refused to do so. Subsequently, on [DATE_TIME], M.P. was served with the documents at her workplace in [LOCATION].\n\nMeanwhile, on [DATE_TIME] the Ministry also upheld M.P.’s appeal against the decision on the enforcement of the interim order. The case was remitted to the Maribor Administrative Unit and the enforcement proceedings were subsequently stayed as a result of the quashing of the interim order.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. informed the Centre of the address of her representative authorised to receive her official mail.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. submitted a proposal regarding the contact schedule between the applicant and P., and on [DATE_TIME] the applicant made a counter-proposal. On [DATE_TIME] the Centre invited [LOCATION] to provide certain information regarding her daughter’s residence, living conditions and education. On [DATE_TIME] M.P. sent a reply to the Centre, without, however, providing the requested information on P. On [DATE_TIME] the Centre again invited M.P. to provide the information, to which she responded on [DATE_TIME], but again failed to provide answers to the Centre’s questions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre held a hearing in the applicant’s presence. M.P., however, did not attend, although a summons had been correctly served on her authorised representative. The applicant reiterated his request for the setting up of a contact schedule between him and P.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre issued an order granting the applicant contact with P. every [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] during [DATE_TIME] periods. According to the order, an appeal against the contact schedule would not have a suspensive effect.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. appealed against the order before the Ministry.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and on [DATE_TIME] the applicant requested that the contact schedule be enforced.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Maribor administrative unit rejected the applicant’s request for enforcement, stating that the order of [DATE_TIME] was unenforceable as the Centre had failed to specify the place at which the applicant was to pick up and drop off his daughter. Subsequently, on [DATE_TIME] the Centre informed the applicant that the order could not be supplemented with the required information, as M.P.’s appeal against it was pending before the Ministry.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ministry upheld M.P.’s appeal against the order of [DATE_TIME], confirming the reasoning of the administrative unit that the order was unenforceable. Moreover, the facts of the case had still not been properly established. The case was remitted to the Centre with the instruction to acquire information on M.P.’s and P.’s place of residence, [PERSON]’s schooling and her [DATE_TIME] activities.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre invited [LOCATION] to provide them with the information requested by the Ministry in their decision of [DATE_TIME]. She did not reply.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre contacted the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with a view to finding the address of [LOCATION] and P. On [DATE_TIME] the Centre was informed that the Slovenian Embassy in [LOCATION] had been unable to obtain such information.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Centre addressed a request for assistance in obtaining the information on M.P.’s and P.’s address to the [LOCATION]. As no reply was received, the Centre requested assistance again on [DATE_TIME].\n\nFurther to legislative changes by which on [DATE_TIME] the courts acquired jurisdiction to decide on issues relating to rights of contact, in [DATE_TIME] the applicant instituted proceedings before the Maribor District Court. At the District Court’s request, the applicant supplemented his application on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Maribor District Court scheduled a hearing for [DATE_TIME]; however, M.P. was unable to attend and only the applicant appeared in court. He complained that M.P. was in the habit of evading the proceedings and that, as a result, he had not seen P. for [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. informed the Maribor District Court that she and [PERSON] had not resided at their [NRP] address for a number of [DATE_TIME] and that she had kept that address only for the purpose of receiving mail. However, she failed to provide her address in [LOCATION]. M.P. proposed that the [NRP] courts relinquish their jurisdiction in the matter in favour of the [NRP] courts.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant sent a letter to the Graz Youth and Family Office asking them for help in re-establishing contact with P. He explained that M.P. had been preventing him from having contact with his daughter and had evaded the proceedings conducted by the Centre and the Maribor District Court. He also attached a letter he had written to [PERSON], with photos of him and his family. The applicant’s letter was handed over to [LOCATION] by a social worker on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Maribor District Court scheduled another hearing for [DATE_TIME], but since M.P. had not been served with a summons to attend, the hearing was adjourned. Scheduling further hearings, on [DATE_TIME] the Maribor District Court asked the Graz District Court for Civil Matters to serve a summons on [LOCATION] in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1348/2000 of [DATE_TIME] on the service in member [LOCATION] of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. The court also attempted to serve the document on M.P. through the Slovenian Embassy in [LOCATION]. However, its attempt was unsuccessful; both the embassy and, on [DATE_TIME], the Graz District Court for Civil Matters notified the Maribor District Court that M.P. did not appear to be living at the indicated address. The Maribor District Court continued sending mail to M.P.’s address in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Maribor District Court again asked the Graz District Court for Civil Matters to serve a summons on [LOCATION] in [LOCATION]. The mail was delivered to her at the Graz District Court for Civil Matters on [DATE_TIME], after the [LOCATION] court had obtained information on M.P.’s address from the Registration Office and two unsuccessful attempts had been made to serve the summons at her home address.\n\nMeanwhile, on [DATE_TIME] the Maribor District Court requested the Graz District Court for Civil Matters to obtain a report on [PERSON]’s situation from the Graz Youth and Family Office. It appears that the request was sent to the [NRP] court on [DATE_TIME] and received by the District Court for Civil Matters on [DATE_TIME]. The latter submitted it to the Youth and Family Office on [DATE_TIME]. The social worker in charge of the case requested three times to meet with M.P. and P. in order to prepare the report, but without success. It appears that M.P. did not attend the first two meetings for work-related reasons. On the last occasion M.P. replied that she and her daughter would be spending [DATE_TIME] abroad. On [DATE_TIME] the Graz Youth and Family Office reported back that M.P. had refused to cooperate. A further request for a report was submitted on [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the Youth and Family Office notified the District Court for Civil Matters that M.P. could not be reached because she was abroad at the time. On [DATE_TIME] the latter court sent a reply to the Maribor District Court, which received it on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Maribor District Court held a hearing and on [DATE_TIME] issued an order setting out a contact schedule. M.P. did not attend the hearing; however, she informed the court that [PERSON] did not wish to have contact with the applicant. The court ruled that the applicant could visit P. [DATE_TIME] by picking her up at M.P.’s home. The court found that there were no objective reasons for P. to refuse contact with her father and that she had been influenced by M.P.’s negative attitude towards the applicant. It also criticised M.P.’s conduct and her “uncooperative attitude”.\n\nM.P. appealed against the contact order.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], on the applicant’s proposal, the Maribor District Court issued an enforceable interim order allowing him contact with P. [DATE_TIME], whereby once a month he was to visit her at her address in [LOCATION] and the other time P. was to visit him in [LOCATION]. Following an objection on the part of M.P. in which she stated that she was unwilling to take P. to [LOCATION], on [DATE_TIME] the Maribor District Court modified the interim order so that visits could take place only in [LOCATION]. M.P. was ordered to comply with the terms of the order, subject to a fine of 200 euros (EUR) for each breach.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant saw [PERSON] for the first time in [DATE_TIME]. They had contact again on [DATE_TIME]. On the latter occasion, [PERSON] left after [DATE_TIME], after which she refused to see the applicant again, although he attempted to see her on at least two more occasions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Maribor Higher Court dismissed an appeal lodged by M.P. against the contact order of [DATE_TIME]. Consequently, the order became final.\n\nMeanwhile from [DATE_TIME], the applicant requested five times that a fine be imposed on M.P. for failure to comply with the interim contact order ([DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant requested for the sixth time that a fine be imposed on M.P. On [DATE_TIME], the Maribor District Court explained to the parties that the contact proceedings had been concluded by a final decision and the Maribor Local Court was competent to decide on the enforcement of the contact order. The District Court referred the applicant’s further request for enforcement of [DATE_TIME] to the Local Court. Subsequently, the applicant lodged another three requests for enforcement on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nMeanwhile, on [DATE_TIME], the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal under the Right to Trial without Undue Delay Act (hereinafter “the 2006 Act”) with a view to accelerating the enforcement proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the Maribor Local Court imposed a fine in the amount of EUR 600 on [LOCATION] for not complying with the contact order. On [DATE_TIME] the President of the Maribor Local Court, in the context of the proceedings in respect of the 2006 Act, informed the applicant of the decision taken [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant replied that none of his other requests had yet been resolved.\n\nM.P. having appealed against the fine, on [DATE_TIME] the Maribor Higher Court set aside the impugned order, stating that a deadline should have first been set for M.P. to comply with the contact order. On [DATE_TIME] the Maribor Local Court invited the applicant to supplement his request for enforcement. On the basis of that request, a new enforcement order was issued on [DATE_TIME], ordering M.P. to allow contact between the applicant and P., subject to a fine in the amount of EUR 500. M.P. appealed against the order.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Maribor Local Court quashed all the enforcement acts executed until that date and dismissed the applicant’s request for enforcement, finding that since the contact between the applicant and [PERSON] was to take place in [LOCATION], the [NRP] courts had jurisdiction to decide on the enforcement.\n\nB. Suspension of the applicant’s contact rights by the [NRP] authorities\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] lodged a request with the [LOCATION]-West District Court seeking suspension of the applicant’s contact rights.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] gave a statement before the District Court, alleging that throughout the period in which she had been living in [LOCATION] the applicant had not wished to have any contact with her and had made no attempts to see her. She further maintained that he had not obtained a court order setting out a contact schedule until [DATE_TIME]. Two visits had been carried out. However, since he had been criticising M.P., she had refused to have any further contact with him, and she had repeatedly told him so. P. also said that she had no relationship with her father and that she was afraid that he would take her to [LOCATION].\n\nThe applicant made a statement before the Maribor District Court on the basis of a letter rogatory submitted by the [NRP] authorities. On [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION]-West District Court suspended his contact rights. It found that [PERSON] had consistently expressed her wish not to have contact with the applicant and concluded that contact against her wishes would not be in her interest. The court also found that M.P. had not obstructed contact and that the applicant had stated in the proceedings that he would respect [PERSON]’s wish not to have contact with him.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Graz Regional Civil Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant, finding that there was no indication that [PERSON] had been manipulated by M.P. or was not expressing her wishes freely.\n\nC. Proceedings concerning [DATE_TIME] child maintenance conducted before the [NRP] authorities\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] M.P. asked the [LOCATION]-West District Court to increase the [DATE_TIME] child maintenance from EUR 137 to EUR 250 on the grounds that P.’s needs, as well as the general cost of living, had increased since [DATE_TIME] when she and the applicant had concluded the maintenance agreement.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court, taking into account the financial situation of both parents, allowed M.P.’s request.\n\nAn appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the Graz District Court for Civil Matters on [DATE_TIME].\n\nDuring the proceedings, the applicant sent a number of letters to the courts in [LOCATION] complaining that the court documents were in [NRP], which he did not understand, and requesting that the issue be decided by the [NRP] authorities.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 11564/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hacı Zeki Uzun (“the applicant”), on 21 March 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms A. Bingöl and Ms G. Kartal, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 14 September 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, a gynaecologist, was born in 1956 and lives in İzmir.\n\nIn the course of an investigation into the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party), an illegal armed organisation, the applicant’s name was mentioned by a few detainees suspected of membership of that organisation and a convicted confessor (itirafcı)0 as having provided assistance to that organisation.\n\nOn 19 October 1999, at around 6.30 p.m., the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody at his medical practice. The applicant claims that he was arrested in a humiliating manner, in front of his staff and patients, and that he was sworn at and beaten in the police car.\n\nOn 20 October 1999 the applicant’s house and medical practice was searched. The applicant claims that the police officers continued to swear, threaten and humiliate him on this occasion.\n\nThe Government submitted that the applicant’s detention in police custody was first prolonged, on 21 October 1999, for an additional two days by the prosecutor and later prolonged, on 23 October 1999, for an additional three days by a judge at the State Security Court.\n\nThe applicant alleges that, while he was in police custody, he was ill‑treated. In particular, he complains of having received electric shocks, of having been suffocated, and of having been beaten and threatened. He also alleges that, during the first three days of his detention, he had been deprived of food and medication and prevented from sleeping.\n\nOn 25 October 1999 the applicant was heard first by the public prosecutor and later by a judge at the İzmir State Security Court. The latter ordered his release from custody.\n\nFollowing the applicant’s complaint, the İzmir public prosecutor instigated an investigation into the events. On 26 November 1999 the İzmir public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the police officers at the anti‑terror branch of the İzmir Security Directorate. In its decision the prosecution noted that none of the persons put forward as witnesses by the applicant were able to confirm the applicant’s version of events, that the applicant was unable to identify the alleged perpetrators and that none of the medical reports, dated 19 October 1999, 23 October 1999 and 25 October 1999 save for one dated 11 November 1999, i.e. fifteen days after the events, noted any physical findings of ill-treatment. The applicant did not object to this decision.\n\nThe criminal proceedings brought against the applicant before the İzmir State Security Court for aiding and abetting an illegal armed organisation ended on 23 May 2000 with his acquittal.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, a gynaecologist, was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nIn the course of an investigation into the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party), an illegal armed organisation, the applicant’s name was mentioned by a few detainees suspected of membership of that organisation and a convicted confessor (itirafcı)0 as having provided assistance to that organisation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], at [DATE_TIME], the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody at his medical practice. The applicant claims that he was arrested in a humiliating manner, in front of his staff and patients, and that he was sworn at and beaten in the police car.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s house and medical practice was searched. The applicant claims that the police officers continued to swear, threaten and humiliate him on this occasion.\n\nThe Government submitted that the applicant’s detention in police custody was first prolonged, on [DATE_TIME], for [DATE_TIME] by the prosecutor and later prolonged, on [DATE_TIME], for [DATE_TIME] by a judge at the State Security Court.\n\nThe applicant alleges that, while he was in police custody, he was ill‑treated. In particular, he complains of having received electric shocks, of having been suffocated, and of having been beaten and threatened. He also alleges that, during [DATE_TIME] of his detention, he had been deprived of food and medication and prevented from sleeping.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was heard first by the public prosecutor and later by a judge at the İzmir State Security Court. The latter ordered his release from custody.\n\nFollowing the applicant’s complaint, the [LOCATION] public prosecutor instigated an investigation into the events. On [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the police officers at the anti‑terror branch of the İzmir Security Directorate. In its decision the prosecution noted that none of the persons put forward as witnesses by the applicant were able to confirm the applicant’s version of events, that the applicant was unable to identify the alleged perpetrators and that none of the medical reports, dated [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] save for one dated [DATE_TIME], i.e. [DATE_TIME] after the events, noted any physical findings of ill-treatment. The applicant did not object to this decision.\n\nThe criminal proceedings brought against the applicant before the İzmir State Security Court for aiding and abetting an illegal armed organisation ended on [DATE_TIME] with his acquittal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1608/08) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Leszek Robert Głowacki (“the applicant”), on 27 December 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr P. Florek, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime on him. He further complained about the length of criminal proceedings against him.\n\nOn 17 November 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nA. First set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn an unknown date in 1991 the applicant was charged with aggravated robbery. In 1993 the Siedlce Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Wojewódzki) stayed the investigation as the applicant’s whereabouts were not known. In July 1993 the applicant was arrested and began serving a prison sentence which had been imposed in 1982.\n\nOn 14 March 1994 a bill of indictment was lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sad Wojewódzki). The applicant was charged with robbery.\n\nThe proceedings were stayed on 6 March 1996 in view of the applicant’s health. In December 1996 he underwent spinal surgery. The trial was resumed on 28 September 1997.\n\nThe applicant failed to appear at some hearings in 2003, however the trial court found that this was because he had been serving a prison sentence imposed in another set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 5 April 2004 the charges against the applicant and several co‑accused were severed and dealt with in a separate set of proceedings.\n\nThe applicant failed to appear at a hearing held on 30 June 2005. On the same date the Warsaw Regional Court (Sad Okręgowy) issued a wanted notice in respect of the applicant and ordered that he be arrested and remanded in custody.\n\nOn 18 July 2005 the court severed the charges against the applicant, to be dealt with in a separate set of the proceedings, and on the same date stayed the proceedings as the applicant was in hiding.\n\nThe applicant was arrested on 18 May 2007. He was placed in the Warsaw Białołęka Detention Centre on 21 May 2007.\n\nOn 11 June 2007 the Warsaw Regional Court resumed the proceedings against the applicant.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the applicant’s detention was extended on 13 August and 17 December 2007 and 26 March, 21 April, 21 July and 26 September 2008. In their decisions on the matter the authorities relied on the original grounds given for holding him in custody. The applicant did not appeal against most of the decisions extending his detention.\n\nOn 22 September 2009 the Warsaw Regional Court convicted the applicant of armed robbery, burglary and causing serious bodily harm and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently extended, in particular on: 26 September and 22 December 2008 and 6 March 2010. The applicant lodged an appeal against the last of those decisions.\n\nOn 10 April 2010, at the applicant’s request, the detention was lifted and he was released from custody.\n\nOn 2 March 2011 the applicant began serving the prison sentence imposed on 22 September 2009.\n\nB. The second set of criminal proceedings\n\nOn an unknown date in 2007 the Płock Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okregowy) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and several co-accused on charges of illegal possession of weapons and robbery.\n\nOn 23 May 2007 the Ostrołeka District Court remanded the applicant in custody, relying on the suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he was charged. It attached importance to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant, the serious nature of the offences of which he was suspected, and the risk that he would go into hiding. This was made more likely by the facts that he did not have a permanent place of residence and was unemployed. The applicant did not appeal against this decision.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the applicant’s detention was extended on 31 July and 15 November 2007 and on 31 January, 18 April and 3 October 2008. The authorities relied on the original grounds given for keeping him in custody.\n\nAppeals by the applicant against the decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him were unsuccessful.\n\nOn 21 January 2008 a bill of indictment was lodged with the Płock Regional Court.\n\nOn 18 December 2008 the Płock Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended.\n\nOn 28 October 2009 the Warsaw Court of Appeal partly upheld the first-instance judgment and partly remitted it. It also sentenced the applicant to one year’s imprisonment. The applicant served this sentence between 18 May 2007 and 18 May 2008.\n\nOn 8 December 2009 the Warsaw Court of Appeal lifted the applicant’s remand in custody.\n\nC. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 1 September 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Court of Appeal under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). The applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Warsaw Regional Court (see paragraphs 6-19 above) had been excessive, and also sought an award of just satisfaction.\n\nOn 15 December 2009 the Court of Appeal gave a decision and dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court considered that there had been no significant delays in the proceedings, as the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings.\n\nD. Imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime\n\n1. Undisputed facts\n\nOn 21 May 2007 the applicant was placed in the Warsaw Białołęka Remand Centre (Areszt Śledczy).\n\nOn 1 June 2007 the Penitentiary Commission of the Warsaw Białołęka Remand Centre classified him as a “dangerous detainee” (tymczasowo aresztowany niebezpieczny) and ordered that he be placed in a closed cell. The commission referred to: the fact that the applicant was accused of armed robbery and using fake police uniforms, and that he had previously escaped from the Warsaw Mokotów Remand Centre, and also to his “serious lack of moral character” and long history of criminal convictions.\n\nEvery three months the Warsaw Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission reviewed and upheld its decision classifying the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. In particular on 26 February 2008 the commission confirmed its previous decision. It considered that it was necessary to place the applicant in solitary confinement as he had been charged with numerous offences, including armed robbery. The commission also referred to “serious lack of moral character”.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the penitentiary courts against most of those decisions, arguing that he was suffering from various health problems including hemiparesis and discopathy, and should not be placed in solitary confinement. He also stressed that he had never been charged with acting as part of an organised criminal group.\n\nAll his appeals were dismissed. The courts gave decisions on 26 May, 29 August and 17 October 2008, 15 April and 24 June 2009, and 4 March 2010. The authorities relied on the grounds given for the initial decision. In particular they stressed the risk posed by the seriousness of the offences and the use of weapons and fake police uniforms.\n\nOn 30 May 2008 the applicant was transferred to Płock Prison so that he could attend the proceedings before the Płock Regional Court (see paragraphs 20-27 above). He was placed alone in a cell for dangerous detainees. This situation applied between 30 May and 4 September 2008 and 9 September and 11 December 2008. The applicant complained about this on several occasions, alleging that due to his health problems, for safety reasons he should have been placed with another inmate.\n\nDue to his “dangerous detainee” status the applicant was under increased supervision. The applicant’s cell in Płock Prison measured 6.92 sq. m. Between 11 December 2008 and 9 January 2009 he shared it with another inmate. Every time the applicant left or entered his cell he was subjected to a body search, which in practice meant that he had to strip naked. Examinations of the applicant’s body, his clothing and shoes were conducted in a separate room, with no third parties present.\n\nThe applicant was ordered to wear “joined shackles” (kajdanki zespolone) on his hands and feet on three occasions during the proceedings before the Płock Regional Court, on 2, 9 and 11 June 2008. Those shackles consisted of handcuffs and fetters joined together with chains. On each occasion he was put in the shackles on his arrival at the court and remained handcuffed throughout the day until the end of the hearing.\n\nThe applicant was allowed to receive visits from his family. According to a list of visits provided by the Government, between 8 July and 28 October 2008 the applicant was visited on four occasions by his sister and son (one visit per month). Subsequently, between 29 June 2009 and 2 November 2009 his sister and son visited him on average once a month. The majority of these visits lasted one hour. Between 28 October 2008 and 4 June 2009 he was not visited by anyone.\n\nOn 8 May 2009 the applicant was granted leave to attend his mother’s funeral.\n\n2. Facts in dispute\n\nThe Government submitted that after his initial complaint the applicant had, in direct conversation with the prison authorities, agreed to be held in solitary confinement.\n\nThe applicant argued that when his complaints were unsuccessful he had had no other choice than to accept the situation which had been imposed on him.\n\nE. Conditions of detention\n\n1. Undisputed facts\n\nThe applicant was detained in the following detention centres: Warsaw Białołeka Detention Centre, Lublin Remand Centre, Warsaw Mokotów Remand Centre, and Płock Prison.\n\nHe failed to lodge a claim for compensation for damage to his health sustained as a result of inadequate conditions of detention.\n\n2. Facts in dispute\n\nThe applicant argued that the living conditions in the detention centres in which he was detained were inadequate. The cells were very small, with approximately 3 sq. m per person. The exercise area was also very small, approximately 15 sq. m.\n\nThe Government submitted that during the applicant’s detention in all four of the penal establishments listed above all standards of detention were respected.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1608/08) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime on him. He further complained about the length of criminal proceedings against him.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. First set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn an unknown date in [DATE_TIME] the applicant was charged with aggravated robbery. In [DATE_TIME] the Siedlce Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Wojewódzki) stayed the investigation as the applicant’s whereabouts were not known. In [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and began serving a prison sentence which had been imposed in [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a bill of indictment was lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sad Wojewódzki). The applicant was charged with robbery.\n\nThe proceedings were stayed on [DATE_TIME] in view of the applicant’s health. In [DATE_TIME] he underwent spinal surgery. The trial was resumed on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant failed to appear at some hearings in [DATE_TIME], however the trial court found that this was because he had been serving a prison sentence imposed in another set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the charges against the applicant and several co‑accused were severed and dealt with in a separate set of proceedings.\n\nThe applicant failed to appear at a hearing held on [DATE_TIME]. On the same date the Warsaw Regional Court ([PERSON]) issued a wanted notice in respect of the applicant and ordered that he be arrested and remanded in custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court severed the charges against the applicant, to be dealt with in a separate set of the proceedings, and on the same date stayed the proceedings as the applicant was in hiding.\n\nThe applicant was arrested on [DATE_TIME]. He was placed in the Warsaw Białołęka Detention Centre on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court resumed the proceedings against the applicant.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the applicant’s detention was extended on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. In their decisions on the matter the authorities relied on the original grounds given for holding him in custody. The applicant did not appeal against most of the decisions extending his detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Regional Court convicted the applicant of armed robbery, burglary and causing serious bodily harm and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently extended, in particular on: [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The applicant lodged an appeal against the last of those decisions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], at the applicant’s request, the detention was lifted and he was released from custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant began serving the prison sentence imposed on [DATE_TIME].\n\nB. The second set of criminal proceedings\n\nOn an unknown date in [DATE_TIME] the Płock Regional Prosecutor ([PERSON]) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and several co-accused on charges of illegal possession of weapons and robbery.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Ostrołeka District Court remanded the applicant in custody, relying on the suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he was charged. It attached importance to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant, the serious nature of the offences of which he was suspected, and the risk that he would go into hiding. This was made more likely by the facts that he did not have a permanent place of residence and was unemployed. The applicant did not appeal against this decision.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the applicant’s detention was extended on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The authorities relied on the original grounds given for keeping him in custody.\n\nAppeals by the applicant against the decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him were unsuccessful.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a bill of indictment was lodged with the Płock Regional Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Płock Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Court of Appeal partly upheld the first-instance judgment and partly remitted it. It also sentenced the applicant to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant served this sentence [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Court of Appeal lifted the applicant’s remand in custody.\n\nC. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Court of Appeal under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). The applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Warsaw Regional Court (see paragraphs 6-19 above) had been excessive, and also sought an award of just satisfaction.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal gave a decision and dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court considered that there had been no significant delays in the proceedings, as the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings.\n\nD. Imposition of the “dangerous detainee” regime\n\n1. Undisputed facts\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was placed in the Warsaw Białołęka Remand Centre ([PERSON]).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Penitentiary Commission of the Warsaw Białołęka Remand Centre classified him as a “dangerous detainee” ([PERSON] aresztowany niebezpieczny) and ordered that he be placed in a closed cell. The commission referred to: the fact that the applicant was accused of armed robbery and using fake police uniforms, and that he had previously escaped from the Warsaw Mokotów Remand Centre, and also to his “serious lack of moral character” and long history of criminal convictions.\n\n[DATE_TIME] the Warsaw Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission reviewed and upheld its decision classifying the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. In particular on [DATE_TIME] the commission confirmed its previous decision. It considered that it was necessary to place the applicant in solitary confinement as he had been charged with numerous offences, including armed robbery. The commission also referred to “serious lack of moral character”.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the penitentiary courts against most of those decisions, arguing that he was suffering from various health problems including hemiparesis and [PERSON], and should not be placed in solitary confinement. He also stressed that he had never been charged with acting as part of an organised criminal group.\n\nAll his appeals were dismissed. The courts gave decisions on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], and [DATE_TIME]. The authorities relied on the grounds given for the initial decision. In particular they stressed the risk posed by the seriousness of the offences and the use of weapons and fake police uniforms.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was transferred to Płock Prison so that he could attend the proceedings before the Płock Regional Court (see paragraphs 20-27 above). He was placed alone in a cell for dangerous detainees. This situation applied between 30 [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The applicant complained about this on several occasions, alleging that due to his health problems, for safety reasons he should have been placed with another inmate.\n\nDue to his “dangerous detainee” status the applicant was under increased supervision. The applicant’s cell in [LOCATION] measured 6.92 sq. m. [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] he shared it with another inmate. Every time the applicant left or entered his cell he was subjected to a body search, which in practice meant that he had to strip naked. Examinations of the applicant’s body, his clothing and shoes were conducted in a separate room, with no third parties present.\n\nThe applicant was ordered to wear “joined shackles” ([PERSON]) on his hands and feet on three occasions during the proceedings before the Płock Regional Court, on 2, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. Those shackles consisted of handcuffs and fetters joined together with chains. On each occasion he was put in the shackles on his arrival at the court and remained handcuffed throughout [DATE_TIME] until the end of the hearing.\n\nThe applicant was allowed to receive visits from his family. According to a list of visits provided by the Government, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the applicant was visited on four occasions by his sister and son (one visit per month). Subsequently, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] his sister and son visited him on average once a month. The majority of these visits lasted [DATE_TIME]. [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] he was not visited by anyone.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was granted leave to attend his mother’s funeral.\n\n2. Facts in dispute\n\nThe Government submitted that after his initial complaint the applicant had, in direct conversation with the prison authorities, agreed to be held in solitary confinement.\n\nThe applicant argued that when his complaints were unsuccessful he had had no other choice than to accept the situation which had been imposed on him.\n\nE. Conditions of detention\n\n1. Undisputed facts\n\nThe applicant was detained in the following detention centres: Warsaw Białołeka Detention Centre, Lublin Remand Centre, Warsaw Mokotów Remand Centre, and [LOCATION].\n\nHe failed to lodge a claim for compensation for damage to his health sustained as a result of inadequate conditions of detention.\n\n2. Facts in dispute\n\nThe applicant argued that the living conditions in the detention centres in which he was detained were inadequate. The cells were very small, with approximately 3 sq. m per person. The exercise area was also very small, approximately 15 sq. m.\n\nThe Government submitted that during the applicant’s detention in all four of the penal establishments listed above all standards of detention were respected.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 40153/98 and 40160/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight Turkish nationals (“the applicants”): Mr Vedat Çetin, who lodged application no. 40153/98 on 5 January 1998, and Mr Mehmet Kaya, Mr Ismet Bakaç, Mr Ahmet Sünbül, Mr Zeynel Bagir, Mr Metin Dag, Mr Kemal Sahin and Mr Naif Kiliç, who jointly lodged application no. 40160/98 on 5 February 1998.\n\nThe applicants were represented before the Court by Mr S. Tanrikulu, of the Diyarbakir Bar. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe object of the applications was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nThe applications were transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe applications were allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber which would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nAfter deciding to join the applications the Chamber declared them partly admissible in a decision of 6 November 2001.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicants are Turkish nationals and live in Diyarbakir. At the material time, they worked as journalists on Ülkede Gündem, a Turkish-language daily newspaper based in Istanbul. Publication of the newspaper ceased on 24 October 1998 and it was replaced initially by Özgür Bakis and subsequently, on 27 April 2000, by another daily newspaper, 2 Binde Yeni Gündem. That newspaper was replaced on 31 May 2001 by a weekly periodical called Yedinci Gündem.\n\nAt the material time one of the applicants, Mr Çetin, an independent journalist, wrote a column entitled “Notes from Diyarbakir” (Diyarbakir'dan Notlar), which was published on Tuesdays in Ülkede Gündem. Mr Bakaç was Ülkede Gündem's representative in Diyarbakir. He currently works as a press officer for the Diyarbakir Urban District Council.\n\nAs for the other applicants, Mr Bagir is now the mayor of Lice, Mr Kaya is a lawyer and Mr Sahin and Mr Kiliç both teach in schools in eastern Turkey. Mr Sünbül continues to work as a journalist with the weekly publication 7. Gündem, while Mr Dag currently works as a press officer for Kayapinar Town Council.\n\nThe main point at issue in the present case is a ban that was imposed on 1 December 1997 by the governor of the state of emergency region on the distribution of Ülkede Gündem in that region.\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Background to the governor of the state of emergency region's decision\n\nAccording to the applicants, the distribution of Ülkede Gündem was impeded by the security forces in the period from September to November 1997, and the governor of the state of emergency region subsequently imposed a ban on its publication and distribution in the region where the state of emergency had been declared (see paragraph 24 below). On 13 November 1997 the proprietor of Ülkede Gündem sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior informing it of the disruption caused to the distribution of the newspaper and demanding an end to these unlawful acts. He also sought compensation for the loss sustained.\n\nOn 19 November 1997 the governor of the state of emergency region wrote to the proprietor of Ülkede Gündem to say that his office was not responsible for the acts mentioned in the letter. He enclosed the seizure orders that had been made by the relevant authorities.\n\nThe Government have produced to the Court seventy-two warrants issued by judges of the Istanbul National Security Court for the seizure of various issues of the newspaper in the months of September, November and December 1997.\n\nOn 4 November 1997 Mr Bakaç and Mr Bagir lodged a criminal complaint with the Diyarbakir public prosecutor's office because of the alleged disruption to the distribution of the newspaper.\n\nOn 25 November 1997 the public prosecutor's office ruled that it had no power to deal with the complaint and referred it to the Diyarbakir Administrative Council under the Prosecution of Civil Servants Act.\n\nOn 5 February 1998 the Diyarbakir Administrative Council held that there was no case to answer in view of the seizure warrants that had been issued by the Istanbul National Security Court. Its decision was upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court on 3 March 2000.\n\nB. The ban on the publication and distribution of Ülkede Gündem in the state of emergency region\n\nOn 1 December 1997 the governor of the state of emergency region imposed a ban on the publication and distribution of Ülkede Gündem in that region.\n\nOn 4 December 1997 the Diyarbakir Security Directorate wrote to Mr Bakaç, in his capacity as Ülkede Gündem's representative in Diyarbakir, informing him of the ban. Its letter read as follows: “Regard being had to Directive no. 1344 issued by the governor's office of the state of emergency region on 1 December 1997, With effect from 1 December 1997 the publication and distribution of the daily newspaper Ülkede Gündem in the provinces in which a state of emergency has been declared under the aforementioned directive (Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van) shall be prohibited.”\n\nLikewise, on 5 December 1997 the Tunceli Security Directorate wrote a letter to the company responsible for distributing the newspaper, Birlesik Basim Dagitim A.S., based in Adana, in the following terms: “Regard being had to Directive no. 1344 issued by the governor's office of the state of emergency region on 1 December 1997, With effect from 1 December 1997 the publication and distribution of the Istanbul daily newspaper Ülkede Gündem in the provinces in which a state of emergency has been declared under the aforementioned directive (Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van) shall be prohibited, pursuant to Article 1 of Legislative Decree no. 430 and section 11(e) of the State of Emergency Act.”\n\nC. The bans imposed on the successor publications to Ülkede Gündem\n\nOn 7 May 1999 the governor of the state of emergency region imposed a ban pursuant to Article 11 (e) of Legislative Decree no. 285 on the publication and distribution of Özgür Bakis, the daily newspaper that had replaced Ülkede Gündem. Similarly, on 1 June 2000 he issued an order prohibiting the publication and distribution of the daily newspaper 2 Binde Yeni Gündem in the state of emergency region. Lastly, on 27 June 2001 the weekly publication Yedinci Gündem, which had replaced 2 Binde Yeni Gündem, met the same fate, with a ban being imposed on its publication and distribution in the region.\n\nThe applicants have produced a notice dated June 2000 which shows that at different times the governor of the state of emergency region imposed bans on the publication and distribution of seventeen periodicals, including Ülkede Gündem, Özgür Bakis and 2 Binde Yeni Gündem.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 40153/98 and 40160/98) against [LOCATION] lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by eight [NRP] nationals (“the applicants”): Mr [PERSON], who lodged application no. 40153/98 on [DATE_TIME], and Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON], who jointly lodged application no. 40160/98 on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicants were represented before the Court by Mr [PERSON], of the Diyarbakir Bar. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe object of the applications was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nThe applications were transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe applications were allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber which would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nAfter deciding to join the applications the Chamber declared them partly admissible in a decision of [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicants are [NRP] nationals and live in [LOCATION]. At the material time, they worked as journalists on Ülkede Gündem, a Turkish-language [DATE_TIME] newspaper based in [LOCATION]. Publication of the newspaper ceased on [DATE_TIME] and it was replaced initially by [PERSON] and subsequently, on [DATE_TIME], by another [DATE_TIME] newspaper, 2 Binde Yeni Gündem. That newspaper was replaced on [DATE_TIME] by a [DATE_TIME] periodical called Yedinci Gündem.\n\nAt the material time one of the applicants, [PERSON], an independent journalist, wrote a column entitled “Notes from Diyarbakir” (Diyarbakir'dan Notlar), which was published on [DATE_TIME] in Ülkede Gündem. [PERSON] was Ülkede Gündem's representative in [LOCATION]. He currently works as a press officer for the Diyarbakir Urban District Council.\n\nAs for the other applicants, [PERSON] is now the mayor of Lice, [PERSON] is a lawyer and Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] both teach in schools in eastern [LOCATION]. Mr [PERSON] continues to work as a journalist with the [DATE_TIME] publication 7. Gündem, while Mr [PERSON] currently works as a press officer for Kayapinar Town Council.\n\nThe main point at issue in the present case is a ban that was imposed on [DATE_TIME] by the governor of the state of emergency region on the distribution of Ülkede Gündem in that region.\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Background to the governor of the state of emergency region's decision\n\nAccording to the applicants, the distribution of Ülkede Gündem was impeded by the security forces in the period from [DATE_TIME], and the governor of the state of emergency region subsequently imposed a ban on its publication and distribution in the region where the state of emergency had been declared (see paragraph 24 below). On [DATE_TIME] the proprietor of Ülkede Gündem sent a letter to the Ministry of the Interior informing it of the disruption caused to the distribution of the newspaper and demanding an end to these unlawful acts. He also sought compensation for the loss sustained.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the governor of the state of emergency region wrote to the proprietor of Ülkede Gündem to say that his office was not responsible for the acts mentioned in the letter. He enclosed the seizure orders that had been made by the relevant authorities.\n\nThe Government have produced to the Court seventy-two warrants issued by judges of the Istanbul National Security Court for the seizure of various issues of the newspaper in [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Mr Bakaç and Mr [PERSON] lodged a criminal complaint with the [LOCATION] public prosecutor's office because of the alleged disruption to the distribution of the newspaper.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor's office ruled that it had no power to deal with the complaint and referred it to the Diyarbakir Administrative Council under the Prosecution of Civil Servants Act.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Diyarbakir Administrative Council held that there was no case to answer in view of the seizure warrants that had been issued by the Istanbul National Security Court. Its decision was upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nB. The ban on the publication and distribution of Ülkede Gündem in the state of emergency region\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the governor of the state of emergency region imposed a ban on the publication and distribution of Ülkede Gündem in that region.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Diyarbakir Security Directorate wrote to [PERSON], in his capacity as Ülkede Gündem's representative in [LOCATION], informing him of the ban. Its letter read as follows: “Regard being had to Directive no. 1344 issued by the governor's office of the state of emergency region on [DATE_TIME], With effect from [DATE_TIME] the publication and distribution of the [DATE_TIME] newspaper Ülkede Gündem in the provinces in which a state of emergency has been declared under the aforementioned directive ([LOCATION], [PERSON], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], Tunceli and [PERSON]) shall be prohibited.”\n\nLikewise, on [DATE_TIME] the Tunceli Security Directorate wrote a letter to the company responsible for distributing the newspaper, Birlesik [PERSON], based in [LOCATION], in the following terms: “Regard being had to Directive no. 1344 issued by the governor's office of the state of emergency region on [DATE_TIME], With effect from [DATE_TIME] the publication and distribution of the [LOCATION] [DATE_TIME] newspaper Ülkede Gündem in the provinces in which a state of emergency has been declared under the aforementioned directive ([LOCATION], [PERSON], [LOCATION], [LOCATION], Tunceli and [PERSON]) shall be prohibited, pursuant to Article 1 of Legislative Decree no. 430 and section 11(e) of the State of Emergency Act.”\n\nC. The bans imposed on the successor publications to Ülkede Gündem\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the governor of the state of emergency region imposed a ban pursuant to Article 11 (e) of Legislative Decree no. 285 on the publication and distribution of Özgür Bakis, the [DATE_TIME] newspaper that had replaced Ülkede Gündem. Similarly, on [DATE_TIME] he issued an order prohibiting the publication and distribution of the [DATE_TIME] newspaper 2 Binde Yeni Gündem in the state of emergency region. Lastly, on [DATE_TIME] the [DATE_TIME] publication Yedinci Gündem, which had replaced 2 Binde Yeni Gündem, met the same fate, with a ban being imposed on its publication and distribution in the region.\n\nThe applicants have produced a notice dated [DATE_TIME] which shows that at different times the governor of the state of emergency region imposed bans on the publication and distribution of seventeen periodicals, including [PERSON], [PERSON] and 2 Binde Yeni Gündem.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31553/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Turkish nationals, Mr Sıddık Onay and Mrs Zinnet Onay, on 27 June 2002.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr M Beştaş, Mr S Karadayı and Mrs M Beştaş, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 12 July 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, Sıddık Onay and Zinnet Onay, were born in 1985 and 1948 respectively and live in Diyarbakır. The second applicant is the mother of the former.\n\nWhen the first applicant (“the applicant”) was 17 years old, on 25 May 2002 at about 2 p.m. he was arrested at his home by police officers from the Department of Peace and Order attached to the Diyarbakır Security Directorate, on suspicion of involvement in various incidents of bag snatching in Diyarbakır.\n\nAccording to the report drafted by the police, the arrest took place on 26 May 2002 at 9.50 p.m. on the street outside his residence. The report stated that the police had acted upon the information of a certain M.D., a fellow detainee, who had cited the applicant's name during his interrogation in relation to the bag snatching in Diyarbakır. The report also stated that the applicant's mother had been informed of the arrest and detention.\n\nOn 26 May 2002 the applicant was given a medical examination at the Forensic Medicine Institute. A subsequent medical report revealed that there were some blade cuts on his left arm which were three or four days old but, apart from those injuries, no signs of possible ill-treatment were noted. The applicant was then taken into custody at the Peace and Order Department.\n\nOn 27 May 2002 at 3.30, 4.15, 4.45, 5.10, 5.35 and 6 p.m., the applicant and M.D. were taken to on-site inspections. A lawyer assigned by the Diyarbakır Bar Association was present during these inspections, when the applicant gave detailed statements as to how he and M.D. had planned and committed the offences.\n\nAround 6.15 p.m. the same day, he was again given a medical examination. The medical report drafted on that occasion recorded no signs of beatings or the use of physical force on the applicant's body. The same day, at the request of the police, the public prosecutor, without seeing the applicant, extended his custody period by two more days under Article 128 § 2 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the report drafted by the police at 6.25 p.m. on that day, the applicant was handed over to the Juvenile Department of the Security Directorate.\n\nOn 28 May 2002 at 10.30 a.m., the applicant was brought for a further medical examination. The medical report prepared on that day noted two bruises of 10 x 2 cm on his right upper arm and a bruise of 5 x 1 cm on his left upper arm just below his shoulder, which were estimated to be two or three days old; some old cutting scars on his arms and chest were also noted. The applicant was given a second medical examination at 4.15 p.m. on the same day. The second medical report confirmed the findings of the first report. These reports both stated that the medical examinations had been performed upon the request of the Peace and Order Department.\n\nOn 29 May 2002 the Juvenile Police took the applicant for a medical examination. The forensic medical report prepared on that occasion recorded the old cutting scars on the applicant's body, but no signs of the use of recent physical force were noted.\n\nOn the same day the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor. In his statement to the public prosecutor, made in the presence of another duty lawyer, the applicant denied the charges against him. The lawyer claimed that the applicant had been ill-treated whilst in police custody and that he still bore the signs of that treatment. He requested that the applicant be referred to the forensic medicine institute for a complete medical report.\n\nLater the same day, the applicant repeated his allegations of ill-treatment before the investigating judge. He alleged that, after the police officers had apprehended him, they blindfolded him; electric shocks were administered to his body; he was beaten with truncheons and forced to admit to the charges. He showed the marks on his body to the judge. The judge noted a bruise of 7 cm about the thickness of a little finger on the applicant's right upper arm, a bruise of 3 cm the thickness of a little finger just under his left shoulder, a scab-covered lesion under his left kneecap, a swelling on his left ankle and some old blade cuts. The applicant was then remanded in custody.\n\nOn 30 May 2002 the applicant's lawyer filed a complaint with the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor's Office, requesting the public prosecutor to bring criminal proceedings against the police officers who had been on duty when the applicant was in their custody. He also repeated that the applicant should be referred for a full medical examination. Subsequently, the public prosecutor launched an investigation into the applicant's complaint of ill-treatment.\n\nOn the same day, the public prosecutor took a detailed statement from the applicant, in which he complained about the police officers and repeated almost the same submissions he had made to the investigating judge, adding that he had not been subjected to further ill-treatment after he had been handed over to the Juvenile Police. He also admitted that the scars on his upper and lower arms as well as his wrist were self-inflicted with metal wire, which he had torn off the cell window, as he could not bear the pain of ill-treatment. After taking the applicant's statement, the public prosecutor issued a letter to the Forensic Medicine Institute, asking for a detailed medical report on the applicant, including an explanation as to the nature and cause of his injuries.\n\nA report submitted by the Forensic Medicine Institute on 30 May 2002 made reference to the previous medical reports dated 26, 27 and 28 May 2002, and drew its own conclusions after the applicant had been examined. It noted that the applicant had a bruise of 5 x 0.5 cm of which the outer line was a green-yellow colour and the centre was purple-dark blue, on the right upper arm, estimated to be three or four days old, and an old scar of 3 x 1 cm on his left kneecap. The bruising was deemed to have been caused by blunt force trauma. The applicant's injures were not regarded as life threatening but classified as sufficient to render him unfit for a day.\n\nOn 18 November 2004 the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the police officers concerned. Referring to all the medical reports, this decision concluded briefly that the lesions had occurred prior to the applicant's arrest and that the scars on his body and arms had been self-inflicted, as he admitted in his statement of 30 May 2002. The applicant challenged this decision before the Siverek Assize Court.\n\nOn 19 January 2005 the Assize Court rejected the applicant's objection.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31553/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by [NRP] nationals, Mr [PERSON] and [PERSON], on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicants were represented by [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON], lawyers practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, [PERSON] and [PERSON], were born in [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] respectively and live in [LOCATION]. The second applicant is the mother of the former.\n\nWhen the first applicant (“the applicant”) was [DATE_TIME], on [DATE_TIME] at [DATE_TIME] he was arrested at his home by police officers from the Department of Peace and Order attached to the Diyarbakır Security Directorate, on suspicion of involvement in various incidents of bag snatching in [LOCATION].\n\nAccording to the report drafted by the police, the arrest took place on [DATE_TIME] at [DATE_TIME] on the street outside his residence. The report stated that the police had acted upon the information of a certain M.D., a fellow detainee, who had cited the applicant's name during his interrogation in relation to the bag snatching in [LOCATION]. The report also stated that the applicant's mother had been informed of the arrest and detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was given a medical examination at the Forensic Medicine Institute. A subsequent medical report revealed that there were some blade cuts on his left arm which were [DATE_TIME] but, apart from those injuries, no signs of possible ill-treatment were noted. The applicant was then taken into custody at the Peace and Order Department.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] at [DATE_TIME], 4.15, 4.45, 5.10, 5.35 and [DATE_TIME], the applicant and [PERSON] were taken to on-site inspections. A lawyer assigned by the Diyarbakır Bar Association was present during these inspections, when the applicant gave detailed statements as to how he and [PERSON] had planned and committed the offences.\n\n[DATE_TIME], he was again given a medical examination. The medical report drafted on that occasion recorded no signs of beatings or the use of physical force on the applicant's body. [DATE_TIME], at the request of the police, the public prosecutor, without seeing the applicant, extended his custody period by [DATE_TIME] under Article 128 § 2 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the report drafted by the police at [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME], the applicant was handed over to the Juvenile Department of the Security Directorate.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] at [DATE_TIME], the applicant was brought for a further medical examination. The medical report prepared on [DATE_TIME] noted two bruises of 10 x 2 cm on his right upper arm and a bruise of 5 x 1 cm on his left upper arm just below his shoulder, which were estimated to be [DATE_TIME]; some old cutting scars on his arms and chest were also noted. The applicant was given a second medical examination at [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME]. The second medical report confirmed the findings of the first report. These reports both stated that the medical examinations had been performed upon the request of the Peace and Order Department.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Juvenile Police took the applicant for a medical examination. The forensic medical report prepared on that occasion recorded the old cutting scars on the applicant's body, but no signs of the use of recent physical force were noted.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor. In his statement to the public prosecutor, made in the presence of another duty lawyer, the applicant denied the charges against him. The lawyer claimed that the applicant had been ill-treated whilst in police custody and that he still bore the signs of that treatment. He requested that the applicant be referred to the forensic medicine institute for a complete medical report.\n\n[DATE_TIME], the applicant repeated his allegations of ill-treatment before the investigating judge. He alleged that, after the police officers had apprehended him, they blindfolded him; electric shocks were administered to his body; he was beaten with truncheons and forced to admit to the charges. He showed the marks on his body to the judge. The judge noted a bruise of 7 cm about the thickness of a little finger on the applicant's right upper arm, a bruise of 3 cm the thickness of a little finger just under his left shoulder, a scab-covered lesion under his left kneecap, a swelling on his left ankle and some old blade cuts. The applicant was then remanded in custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant's lawyer filed a complaint with the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor's Office, requesting the public prosecutor to bring criminal proceedings against the police officers who had been on duty when the applicant was in their custody. He also repeated that the applicant should be referred for a full medical examination. Subsequently, the public prosecutor launched an investigation into the applicant's complaint of ill-treatment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the public prosecutor took a detailed statement from the applicant, in which he complained about the police officers and repeated almost the same submissions he had made to the investigating judge, adding that he had not been subjected to further ill-treatment after he had been handed over to the Juvenile Police. He also admitted that the scars on his upper and lower arms as well as his wrist were self-inflicted with metal wire, which he had torn off the cell window, as he could not bear the pain of ill-treatment. After taking the applicant's statement, the public prosecutor issued a letter to the Forensic Medicine Institute, asking for a detailed medical report on the applicant, including an explanation as to the nature and cause of his injuries.\n\nA report submitted by the Forensic Medicine Institute on [DATE_TIME] made reference to the previous medical reports dated 26, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], and drew its own conclusions after the applicant had been examined. It noted that the applicant had a bruise of 5 x 0.5 cm of which the outer line was a green-yellow colour and the centre was purple-dark blue, on the right upper arm, estimated to be [DATE_TIME], and an old scar of 3 x 1 cm on his left kneecap. The bruising was deemed to have been caused by blunt force trauma. The applicant's injures were not regarded as life threatening but classified as sufficient to render him unfit for [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute the police officers concerned. Referring to all the medical reports, this decision concluded briefly that the lesions had occurred prior to the applicant's arrest and that the scars on his body and arms had been self-inflicted, as he admitted in his statement of [DATE_TIME]. The applicant challenged this decision before the Siverek Assize Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Assize Court rejected the applicant's objection.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 27556/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Ireneusz Lachowski (“the applicant”), on 8 August 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms D. Wojdyło-Nafalska, a lawyer practising in Chełm. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 19 December 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Rejowiec Fabryczny.\n\nThe applicant was arrested on 20 September 1999 on suspicion of homicide. On 22 September 1999 the Chełm District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of 3 months in view of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed homicide. It further held that the likelihood that he would be given a heavy sentence justified his detention on remand.\n\nOn 14 December 1999 the Lublin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged the applicant’s detention until 19 March 2000. It relied on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offence in question and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed on the applicant. In addition, it had regard to the need to obtain expert evidence and a psychiatric examination of the suspects.\n\nOn 8 March 2000 the Lublin Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention until 19 June 2000. It found that in the light of the evidence obtained there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offence. Furthermore, it relied on the severity of the likely sentence and the need to obtain further expert evidence. On 24 May 2000 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention until 4 September 2000, reiterating the grounds previously given. It appears that his detention was subsequently prolonged on an unspecified later date.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the Regional Prosecutor obtained voluminous evidence and took a series of investigative measures. On 10 July 2000 the prosecution service filed a bill of indictment with the Lublin Regional Court. The applicant was charged with two counts of homicide and armed robbery. There were four other defendants in the case.\n\nOn 20 March 2001 the Regional Court ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until 19 September 2001. It held that the gravity of the charges and the likelihood that the applicant would be given a heavy sentence confirmed the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings. It further held that the applicant’s detention on remand was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. Lastly, when extending the applicant’s detention, the Regional Court had regard to its caseload.\n\nOn 19 September 2001 the Court of Appeal granted the Regional Court’s application and prolonged the applicant’s detention until 31 December 2001. It noted that the period of the applicant’s detention had reached the 2-year statutory time-limit (Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and criticised the trial court for not having indicated any particular circumstances which would justify the prolongation beyond the statutory time-limit. However, it held that the prolongation was justified on account of other significant obstacles to progress in the proceedings, namely the fact that one of the defendants had failed to appear at the hearing which had led to the adjournment of the trial. The Court of Appeal also noted that although the bill of indictment had been filed on 10 July 2000, the trial court listed the first hearing only for 16 May 2001.\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged on 28 November 2001 (until 15 March 2002), on 13 March 2002 (until 30 April 2002) and on 24 April 2002 (until 30 September 2002). In all those decisions the Court of Appeal relied on the same grounds as had been given in the earlier decisions.\n\nThe trial court held 20 hearings in the period from 16 May 2001 to 19 September 2002. On 23 September 2002 the Lublin Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment. The applicant, who remained in detention, appealed against the first-instance judgment.\n\nOn 22 October 2003 the Lublin Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Regional Court and ordered a retrial.\n\nIt appears that the applicant’s detention was prolonged on further unspecified dates. On 7 May 2004 the Regional Court ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until 31 December 2004. The applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged on 3 December 2004 (until 31 March 2005), on 29 March 2005 (until 30 September 2005) and on 19 September 2005 (until 31 December 2005). In all those decisions, the Regional Court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision of 3 December 2004 to prolong his detention. He argued, in particular, that the Regional Court had failed to explain why other non-custodial measures were considered insufficient in his case. On 21 December 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the contested decision. It agreed with the applicant that the reasons given by the Regional Court were very brief and general. However, referring to Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, it held that the applicant’s continued detention served the public interest of protecting society, given that the applicant had been charged with the homicide of two women, having first cruelly treated them.\n\nIn its decision of 20 April 2005 upholding the decision of 29 March on the prolongation of the applicant’s detention, the Court of Appeal held that his continued detention on the basis of Article 258 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure remained valid. Having regard to the nature of the alleged offences, it held that Article 258 § 2 established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on an accused might induce him to obstruct the proceedings.\n\nOn 5 October 2005 the Court of Appeal, having examined the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 19 September 2005 on prolongation of his detention, ordered the applicant’s release under police supervision. It also imposed a ban on leaving the country. The Court of Appeal had regard to the excessive length of the applicant’s detention on remand and the fact that the process of hearing evidence was very advanced. In those circumstances, it was not necessary to prolong further the applicant’s detention. The Court of Appeal also noted that despite the significant length of the applicant’s detention, the Regional Court had failed to ensure the diligent conduct of the trial and, in particular, had not held hearings at reasonable intervals. Furthermore, it observed that the reasons for the continued detention as given by the Regional Court in its decision of 19 September 2005 were very terse. The applicant was released on 6 October 2005.\n\nThe Regional Court held 22 hearings in the period from 28 January 2004 to 11 April 2006. The proceedings are still pending.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 27556/03) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in Rejowiec Fabryczny.\n\nThe applicant was arrested on [DATE_TIME] on suspicion of homicide. On [DATE_TIME] the Chełm District Court ([PERSON]) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for [DATE_TIME] in view of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed homicide. It further held that the likelihood that he would be given a heavy sentence justified his detention on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offence in question and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed on the applicant. In addition, it had regard to the need to obtain expert evidence and a psychiatric examination of the suspects.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It found that in the light of the evidence obtained there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offence. Furthermore, it relied on the severity of the likely sentence and the need to obtain further expert evidence. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME], reiterating the grounds previously given. It appears that his detention was subsequently prolonged on [DATE_TIME].\n\nIn the course of the investigation the Regional Prosecutor obtained voluminous evidence and took a series of investigative measures. On [DATE_TIME] the prosecution service filed a bill of indictment with the Lublin Regional Court. The applicant was charged with two counts of homicide and armed robbery. There were four other defendants in the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until [DATE_TIME]. It held that the gravity of the charges and the likelihood that the applicant would be given a heavy sentence confirmed the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings. It further held that the applicant’s detention on remand was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. Lastly, when extending the applicant’s detention, the Regional Court had regard to its caseload.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal granted the Regional Court’s application and prolonged the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It noted that the period of the applicant’s detention had reached the [DATE_TIME] statutory time-limit (Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) and criticised the trial court for not having indicated any particular circumstances which would justify the prolongation beyond the statutory time-limit. However, it held that the prolongation was justified on account of other significant obstacles to progress in the proceedings, namely the fact that one of the defendants had failed to appear at the hearing which had led to the adjournment of the trial. The Court of Appeal also noted that although the bill of indictment had been filed on [DATE_TIME], the trial court listed the first hearing only for [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged on [DATE_TIME] (until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (until [DATE_TIME]) and on [DATE_TIME] (until [DATE_TIME]). In all those decisions the Court of Appeal relied on the same grounds as had been given in the earlier decisions.\n\nThe trial court held 20 hearings in the period from [DATE_TIME] to 19 September 2002. On [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant, who remained in detention, appealed against the first-instance judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Regional Court and ordered a retrial.\n\nIt appears that the applicant’s detention was prolonged on further unspecified dates. On [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until [DATE_TIME]. The applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged on [DATE_TIME] (until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (until [DATE_TIME]) and on [DATE_TIME] (until [DATE_TIME]). In all those decisions, the Regional Court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision of [DATE_TIME] to prolong his detention. He argued, in particular, that the Regional Court had failed to explain why other non-custodial measures were considered insufficient in his case. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal upheld the contested decision. It agreed with the applicant that the reasons given by the Regional Court were very brief and general. However, referring to Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, it held that the applicant’s continued detention served the public interest of protecting society, given that the applicant had been charged with the homicide of two women, having first cruelly treated them.\n\nIn its decision of [DATE_TIME] upholding the decision of [DATE_TIME] on the prolongation of the applicant’s detention, the Court of Appeal held that his continued detention on the basis of Article 258 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure remained valid. Having regard to the nature of the alleged offences, it held that Article 258 § 2 established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on an accused might induce him to obstruct the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal, having examined the applicant’s appeal against the decision of [DATE_TIME] on prolongation of his detention, ordered the applicant’s release under police supervision. It also imposed a ban on leaving the country. The Court of Appeal had regard to the excessive length of the applicant’s detention on remand and the fact that the process of hearing evidence was very advanced. In those circumstances, it was not necessary to prolong further the applicant’s detention. The Court of Appeal also noted that despite the significant length of the applicant’s detention, the Regional Court had failed to ensure the diligent conduct of the trial and, in particular, had not held hearings at reasonable intervals. Furthermore, it observed that the reasons for the continued detention as given by the Regional Court in its decision of [DATE_TIME] were very terse. The applicant was released on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Regional Court held 22 hearings in the period from [DATE_TIME]. The proceedings are still pending.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36801/06) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Swedish national, Mrs Monica Fexler (“the applicant”), on 30 August 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Ulf Jacobson, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Anna Erman from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the administrative appellate courts had failed to hold an oral hearing in proceedings relating to her request for disability benefits.\n\nOn 27 November 2007 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nThe application was later transferred to the Fifth Section of the Court, following the re-composition of the Court’s sections on 1 February 2011.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Hallabro.\n\nSince June 2000, the applicant has been on 100% sick leave due to various health problems. She has, inter alia, been operated on for cancer as the consequence of which she suffers from recurrent Erysipelas (a bacterial infection of the skin, which typically involves the lymphatic system) and lymphatic oedema in both legs.\n\nHence, on 18 June 2001, the applicant applied for disability benefits (handikappersättning) retroactively from June 1999. She claimed that, due to her health problems, she had incurred, and still incurred, extra costs for, inter alia, medication, doctors’ visits, treatment, travel expenses, special clothes and shoes, special soap and creams, and for supplementary vitamins and minerals. She had calculated that these extra costs amounted, in total, to SEK 75,314 (approximately EUR 8,150) per year.\n\nOn 3 May 2002 the Social Insurance Office (försäkringskassan –hereinafter “the Office”) of the County of Blekinge rejected the request. It accepted certain extra costs for medication, medical treatment and support material as well as for certain travel up to a specific amount. However, in the Office’s view, the total of the applicant’s extra costs per year amounted to no more than SEK 7,300 from September 1999, SEK 8,900 from January 2000 and SEK 6,800 from January 2001. Thus, the Office concluded that the applicant’s extra costs did not reach the minimum level established for each year to be granted disability benefits (namely SEK 10,374 for 1999, SEK 10,431 for 2000 and SEK 10,517 for 2001, which was equal to 28.5% of the basic amount in line with the price index [basbelopp]). It further noted that the applicant had claimed that she needed help with shopping and some cleaning and driving but that she had not stated that she had a daily need for assistance. In this respect, the Office took into account that the applicant was married and could rely on some help from her husband. Therefore, it considered that she had failed to show that she had a substantial need of assistance in her daily life (minimum two hours per day). Finally, it found that the total need of support was not sufficient for disability benefits to be granted. The decision was based on Sections 5 and 6 of the Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance (Lagen om handikappersättning och vårdbidrag, Act no. 1998:703) and the Office also had two medical certificates at its disposal from different doctors who had treated the applicant.\n\nBy letter dated 23 May 2002 the applicant appealed against the decision to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Blekinge, requesting that the decision be set aside and that the case be remitted to the Office for further action. In the alternative, she requested that the court declare her entitled to disability benefits as from June 1999. She maintained her claims and developed her reasons for why the various extra costs were essential. She further added that the Office had failed to investigate her actual need for assistance, which she alleged amounted to one hour per day, in order to estimate the total cost of extra needs due to the disability. Moreover, the applicant stated that she needed manual lymphatic drainage which the County Council of Blekinge lacked resources to provide. Since her need was medically documented, she had to travel to a neighbouring county for treatment at her own expense. In this connection, she alleged that she was unable, due to her illness, to use public transport for which reason her travel expenses were higher than calculated by the Office. All these extra costs should, in her view, be included in the calculation to grant her disability benefits.\n\nOn 26 February 2003 the County Administrative Court rejected the appeal. As concerned the applicant’s need of assistance in her daily life, the court considered that it was the common responsibility of a couple to clean and shop, for which reason the applicant was not found to be in need of assistance from a third person in her daily life. The applicant was not considered to be in need of assistance on a daily basis to such an extent that this alone could constitute a basis for granting disability benefits. Turning to the extra costs, the court shared the Office’s conclusions and calculations but added some additional costs for special soap. It also observed that the County Council was responsible for the costs related to the treatment for lymphatic drainage and that these costs thus could not be included in the calculation of disability benefits. Furthermore, it found that the medical certificates invoked before it did not show that the applicant was unable to use public transport. The court concluded, in an overall assessment of the applicant’s need of assistance and of her extra costs, that the conditions for granting disability benefits were not fulfilled and, thus, that the applicant was not eligible for a disability allowance.\n\nBy letter dated 1 March 2003 the applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Jönköping, maintaining her earlier claims and insisting that she was in need of assistance for one hour per day. She further noted that according to the calculation based on the lower court’s judgment, the total amount of extra costs acknowledged by the court was only SEK 41 (approximately EUR 4.50) below the limit to be granted disability benefits for the year 2000. Moreover, the applicant alleged that she had to buy custom-made clothes and special shoes due to her deformities caused by the lymphatic oedema and hip problems. These costs, and the costs for the lymphatic drainage, should be included. She requested that the court order the Office to submit information about how it had calculated her total need for assistance.\n\nOn 29 March 2004 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request for further investigation of the case as it considered that the case had been clarified to the extent that was demanded. The applicant was given one month to submit, in writing, any further information that she wished to add.\n\nOn 8 June 2004 the Administrative Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal and, by letter dated 21 September 2004, the applicant requested that the court hold an oral hearing because she considered the investigation to be incomplete and, for that reason, points about the matter to be decided remained unclear.\n\nIn a decision of 27 September 2004, the Administrative Court of Appeal declared its intention to obtain supplementary information from the Office, as it found it necessary to investigate the case further. On 30 September 2004 the Administrative Court of Appeal ordered the Office to submit supplementary information about lymphatic drainage treatment.\n\nIn a supplementary submission by the applicant, dated 24 November 2004, she stated that she had been in contact with Blekinge hospital to clarify whether it was now possible to carry out manual lymphatic drainage there. She had received various replies but, according to the latest reply, it was not possible although some private therapist within the county apparently could do it. She demanded that an oral hearing be held by telephone to clarify certain unclear points of the case. During the oral hearing, the Administrative Court of Appeal ought to establish that the hospital lacked resources to provide continuous manual lymphatic drainage treatment, that the frequency of the treatments, as stated in the application for disability benefits, was medically motivated and that costs incurred for treatment performed by private providers were extra costs in the present circumstances. Furthermore, the court ought to clarify contradictions in the Office’s submission and calculate the time needed for assistance as well as the total need for support.\n\nOn 21 April 2005 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request for an oral hearing “per telephone” as it found that it was not necessary. The applicant was given three weeks to finalise her submissions in writing and she was informed that, after that time, the case could be decided on the basis of the case file as it stood.\n\nBy a judgment of 14 June 2005, the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full. The court, consisting of five judges including two lay judges, found it established that lymphatic drainage treatment of the kind the applicant needed was to be regarded as medical treatment and that the County Council was responsible for costs of such treatment to the extent that it could be considered medically motivated. Accordingly, when assessing the application for disability benefits, the applicant was not entitled to include extra costs for lymphatic drainage treatment. In the light of this and as the court also shared the County Administrative Court’s assessment concerning the remainder of the subject‑matter the appeal was to be rejected. The judgment was unanimous.\n\nBy letter dated 19 July 2005 the applicant made a further appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten), requesting that the Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment be repealed and the case returned for renewed examination since it had failed to hold an oral hearing. She referred to Article 6 of the Convention and claimed that an oral hearing was necessary in order to clarify the case, in particular her need for assistance. In the alternative, the applicant requested that the court grant her disability benefits.\n\nOn 17 May 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36801/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mrs [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, [PERSON] from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the administrative appellate courts had failed to hold an oral hearing in proceedings relating to her request for disability benefits.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nThe application was later transferred to the Fifth Section of the Court, following the re-composition of the Court’s sections on [DATE_TIME].\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nSince [DATE_TIME], the applicant has been on 100% sick leave due to various health problems. She has, inter alia, been operated on for cancer as the consequence of which she suffers from recurrent [PERSON] (a bacterial infection of the skin, which typically involves the lymphatic system) and lymphatic oedema in both legs.\n\nHence, on [DATE_TIME], the applicant applied for disability benefits (handikappersättning) retroactively from [DATE_TIME]. She claimed that, due to her health problems, she had incurred, and still incurred, extra costs for, inter alia, medication, doctors’ visits, treatment, travel expenses, special clothes and shoes, special soap and creams, and for supplementary vitamins and minerals. She had calculated that these extra costs amounted, in total, to SEK 75,314 (approximately EUR 8,150) per year.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Social Insurance Office (försäkringskassan –hereinafter “the Office”) of [LOCATION] rejected the request. It accepted certain extra costs for medication, medical treatment and support material as well as for certain travel up to a specific amount. However, in the Office’s view, the total of the applicant’s extra costs per year amounted to no more than SEK 7,300 from [DATE_TIME], [LOCATION] 8,900 from [DATE_TIME] and SEK 6,800 from [DATE_TIME]. Thus, the Office concluded that the applicant’s extra costs did not reach the minimum level established for [DATE_TIME] to be granted disability benefits (namely SEK 10,374 for [DATE_TIME], SEK 10,431 for [DATE_TIME] and SEK 10,517 for [DATE_TIME], which was equal to 28.5% of the basic amount in line with the price index [basbelopp]). It further noted that the applicant had claimed that she needed help with shopping and some cleaning and driving but that she had not stated that she had a [DATE_TIME] need for assistance. In this respect, the Office took into account that the applicant was married and could rely on some help from her husband. Therefore, it considered that she had failed to show that she had a substantial need of assistance in her daily life (minimum [DATE_TIME] per day). Finally, it found that the total need of support was not sufficient for disability benefits to be granted. The decision was based on Sections 5 and 6 of the Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance (Lagen om handikappersättning och vårdbidrag, Act no. 1998:703) and the Office also had two medical certificates at its disposal from different doctors who had treated the applicant.\n\nBy letter dated [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed against the decision to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of [LOCATION], requesting that the decision be set aside and that the case be remitted to the Office for further action. In the alternative, she requested that the court declare her entitled to disability benefits as from [DATE_TIME]. She maintained her claims and developed her reasons for why the various extra costs were essential. She further added that the Office had failed to investigate her actual need for assistance, which she alleged amounted to [DATE_TIME] per day, in order to estimate the total cost of extra needs due to the disability. Moreover, the applicant stated that she needed manual lymphatic drainage which the County Council of Blekinge lacked resources to provide. Since her need was medically documented, she had to travel to a neighbouring county for treatment at her own expense. In this connection, she alleged that she was unable, due to her illness, to use public transport for which reason her travel expenses were higher than calculated by the Office. All these extra costs should, in her view, be included in the calculation to grant her disability benefits.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the County Administrative Court rejected the appeal. As concerned the applicant’s need of assistance in her daily life, the court considered that it was the common responsibility of a couple to clean and shop, for which reason the applicant was not found to be in need of assistance from a third person in her daily life. The applicant was not considered to be in need of assistance on a [DATE_TIME] basis to such an extent that this alone could constitute a basis for granting disability benefits. Turning to the extra costs, the court shared the Office’s conclusions and calculations but added some additional costs for special soap. It also observed that the County Council was responsible for the costs related to the treatment for lymphatic drainage and that these costs thus could not be included in the calculation of disability benefits. Furthermore, it found that the medical certificates invoked before it did not show that the applicant was unable to use public transport. The court concluded, in an overall assessment of the applicant’s need of assistance and of her extra costs, that the conditions for granting disability benefits were not fulfilled and, thus, that the applicant was not eligible for a disability allowance.\n\nBy letter dated [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in [LOCATION], maintaining her earlier claims and insisting that she was in need of assistance for [DATE_TIME] per day. She further noted that according to the calculation based on the lower court’s judgment, the total amount of extra costs acknowledged by the court was only SEK 41 (approximately EUR 4.50) below the limit to be granted disability benefits for [DATE_TIME]. Moreover, the applicant alleged that she had to buy custom-made clothes and special shoes due to her deformities caused by the lymphatic oedema and hip problems. These costs, and the costs for the lymphatic drainage, should be included. She requested that the court order the Office to submit information about how it had calculated her total need for assistance.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request for further investigation of the case as it considered that the case had been clarified to the extent that was demanded. The applicant was given [DATE_TIME] to submit, in writing, any further information that she wished to add.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Administrative Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal and, by letter dated [DATE_TIME], the applicant requested that the court hold an oral hearing because she considered the investigation to be incomplete and, for that reason, points about the matter to be decided remained unclear.\n\nIn a decision of [DATE_TIME], the Administrative Court of Appeal declared its intention to obtain supplementary information from the Office, as it found it necessary to investigate the case further. On [DATE_TIME] the Administrative Court of Appeal ordered the Office to submit supplementary information about lymphatic drainage treatment.\n\nIn a supplementary submission by the applicant, dated [DATE_TIME], she stated that she had been in contact with [LOCATION] to clarify whether it was now possible to carry out manual lymphatic drainage there. She had received various replies but, according to the latest reply, it was not possible although some private therapist within the county apparently could do it. She demanded that an oral hearing be held by telephone to clarify certain unclear points of the case. During the oral hearing, the Administrative Court of Appeal ought to establish that the hospital lacked resources to provide continuous manual lymphatic drainage treatment, that the frequency of the treatments, as stated in the application for disability benefits, was medically motivated and that costs incurred for treatment performed by private providers were extra costs in the present circumstances. Furthermore, the court ought to clarify contradictions in the Office’s submission and calculate the time needed for assistance as well as the total need for support.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s request for an oral hearing “per telephone” as it found that it was not necessary. The applicant was given [DATE_TIME] to finalise her submissions in writing and she was informed that, after that time, the case could be decided on the basis of the case file as it stood.\n\nBy a judgment of [DATE_TIME], the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment in full. The court, consisting of five judges including two lay judges, found it established that lymphatic drainage treatment of the kind the applicant needed was to be regarded as medical treatment and that the County Council was responsible for costs of such treatment to the extent that it could be considered medically motivated. Accordingly, when assessing the application for disability benefits, the applicant was not entitled to include extra costs for lymphatic drainage treatment. In the light of this and as the court also shared the County Administrative Court’s assessment concerning the remainder of the subject‑matter the appeal was to be rejected. The judgment was unanimous.\n\nBy letter dated [DATE_TIME] the applicant made a further appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten), requesting that the Administrative Court of Appeal’s judgment be repealed and the case returned for renewed examination since it had failed to hold an oral hearing. She referred to Article 6 of the Convention and claimed that an oral hearing was necessary in order to clarify the case, in particular her need for assistance. In the alternative, the applicant requested that the court grant her disability benefits.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35630/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Igor Chernyshov (“the applicant”), on 12 August 2002.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr P. Sendecki, a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his pre-trial detention exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 6 December 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Polish Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1). The Ukrainian Government did not exercise their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b) of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977. He is currently detained in Hrubieszów Prison.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre-trial detention\n\nOn 19 August 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn 20 August 1998 the Słubice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence or go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court relied on the fact that he did not have his place of residence in Poland. It also stressed the severity of the anticipated prison sentence.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on 14 October 1998 to 15 January 1999. The Słubice District Court relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention. It also underlined that the applicant was a foreign national and therefore there was a risk of his absconding if released.\n\nThe applicant asserted that at the early stage of the investigation he had admitted to having committed the offence he had been charged with. He further submitted that he had agreed to cooperate with the authorities in order to have his future sentence mitigated.\n\nOn 28 December 1998 the Słubice District Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). The applicant was charged with murder. The bill of indictment comprised several charges brought against three defendants.\n\nThe applicant was tried on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of 6 June 1997 (the so-called “New Criminal Code”) which entered into force on 1 September 1998, replacing the Criminal Code of 19 April 1969 (the so-called “Old Criminal Code”). According to Article 4 of the New Criminal Code, in the event that a case is being examined at a time when the New Criminal Code is in force but concerns an offence which was committed prior to its entry into force, the new law shall nevertheless apply if it is more lenient for the perpetrator (względniejszy dla sprawcy).\n\nOn 18 February and 18 March 1999 the trial court held hearings. The applicant pleaded guilty before the trial court. In particular, he testified that he had committed the murder together with a certain W.B. and a certain A.T.\n\nDuring the trial the authorities further extended the applicant’s detention pending trial on 13 January 1999 (to 15 June 1999). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention.\n\nOn 18 March 1999 the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment. The court noted, inter alia, that although the applicant pleaded guilty, his testimonies had not been fully coherent and contained a number of inconsistencies. It therefore considered that the conditions for the extraordinary mitigation of sentence had not been met in the case.\n\nThe applicant, other co-accused and the District Prosecutor appealed. The applicant’s legal-aid counsel argued that the first-instance court had not mitigated the applicant’s sentence as required by Article 60 § 3 of the New Criminal Code, despite the fact that the applicant had cooperated with the authorities. According to that provision, a domestic court shall mitigate the sentence if the defendant committed the offence with accomplices, and revealed to the prosecution information about the persons involved in the commission of the offence and any significant circumstances in which the offence was committed.\n\nThe applicant was kept in detention pending appeal.\n\nOn 23 November 1999 the Poznań Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) heard the appeals. It quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for retrial. The appellate court observed at the outset that the appeals lodged by the applicant and the District Prosecutor contested only the severity of the penalty imposed and not the applicant’s guilt which was clearly established. It further considered the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant to be reasonable. However, it found that the evidence examined by the first-instance court had not been sufficient to allow for a definite conclusion as to whether or not the provision on the mitigation of the sentence was applicable in the circumstances of the case, namely whether or not the applicant had disclosed a full and accurate account of events. It further ordered that the applicant’s detention should continue until 30 April 2000. The court repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention. In addition, it underlined the need to obtain a report from an expert in graphology.\n\nOn 15 February, 21 March and 11 April 2000 the trial court held hearings.\n\nOn 18 April 2000 the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court convicted the applicant as originally charged and sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment. The other defendants were likewise convicted.\n\nThe applicant, other co-accused and the District Prosecutor appealed. The applicant remained detained pending appeal.\n\nIt appears that the applicant changed his testimony in that he no longer claimed that A.T. had been an accomplice to the offence he had been charged with. He continued to admit his own guilt.\n\nOn 9 November 2000 the Poznań Court of Appeal again quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for retrial. It ordered that the applicant’s detention should continue until 31 January 2001.\n\nOn 14 March, 15 March and 27 April 2001 the trial court held hearings.\n\nIn the retrial proceedings the applicant made numerous, unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against decisions extending his detention. The relevant decisions on the extension of his detention were given by the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court on 30 January 2001 (to 30 April 2001), on 27 April 2001 (to 27 July 2001), on 10 July 2001 (to 10 October 2001) and on 9 October 2001 (to 9 January 2002).\n\nOn 5 December 2001 the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court convicted the applicant as originally charged and sentenced him to 25 years’ imprisonment. As concerns the other defendants, the court convicted W.B. but acquitted A.T.\n\nThe applicant appealed. The applicant’s legal-aid counsel argued, inter alia, that the trial court had erred in that it had not mitigated the applicant’s sentence. The lawyer noted that the material in the case file clearly indicated that the applicant had cooperated with the authorities and therefore had complied with the requirements of Article 60 § 3 of the New Criminal Code. Admittedly, the applicant had changed his pleadings after the judgment of 18 April 2000. That, however, should not have had any bearing on the outcome of the case, since the applicant had undoubtedly been coerced into changing his testimony by his co-defendants.\n\nOn 16 May 2002 the Poznań Court of Appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment. It acknowledged that the applicant had given an account of his own wrongdoing. The court observed however that the remainder of his testimony, in particular in part regarding the responsibility of other co-accused had not been credible and had not been taken into consideration by the trial court. The appellate court concluded that the applicant’s testimonies had not been wholly credible and therefore he was not entitled to an extraordinary mitigation of his sentence.\n\nBy letter of 3 December 2002 the applicant’s legal-aid lawyer informed the Poznań Court of Appeal that he had not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal in the case.\n\nIt appears that throughout the trial the applicant was represented by a lawyer assigned to him under the legal-aid scheme. The applicant submitted that between 1999 and 2000 his legal-aid lawyer had never met him to prepare the case and had put forward an ineffective defence.\n\nB. Conditions of the applicant’s detention\n\nOn 19 August 1998 the applicant was committed to Międzyrzecz Remand Centre. Since that date he has been continuously detained in several penitentiary facilities. On 10 December 2007 the applicant was transferred to Hrubieszów Prison where he is currently detained.\n\nThe parties gave partly differing accounts of the conditions of the applicant’s detention.\n\nThe applicant maintained that during most part of his detention he was held in overcrowded cells in conditions which did not comply with the basic standards of hygiene.\n\nThe Government submitted that they could not formally confirm whether during his detention from 19 August 1998 to 28 November 2000, from 22 March to 25 April 2001, from 6 June to 29 November 2001, from 28 February to 15 May 2002, from 27 August to 29 November 2002, from 7 to 18 March 2003 and from 26 August 2005 to 2 February 2006 the applicant was detained in cells with a surface area of at least 3 m² per person. The Government further submitted that the period of the applicant’s detention in cells in which the statutory minimum requirement of 3 m² per person had not been respected amounted to some 979 days. Finally, they maintained that the applicant was currently detained in a cell in which the statutory minimum requirement of 3 m² per person was respected. This submission was not contested by the applicant.\n\nAt the beginning of his detention the applicant lodged numerous complaints with the penitentiary authorities regarding the conditions of his detention. He submitted that he had later given up as his complaints had no prospects of success and he had feared being persecuted by the prison authorities. The applicant did not bring a civil action in tort to seek compensation for the infringement of his personal rights.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35630/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his pre-trial detention exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Polish Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1). The Ukrainian Government did not exercise their right to intervene (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 (b) of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME]. He is currently detained in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre-trial detention\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Słubice District Court ([PERSON]) remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence or go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court relied on the fact that he did not have his place of residence in [LOCATION]. It also stressed the severity of the anticipated prison sentence.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on [DATE_TIME] to [DATE_TIME]. The Słubice District Court relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention. It also underlined that the applicant was a foreign national and therefore there was a risk of his absconding if released.\n\nThe applicant asserted that at the early stage of the investigation he had admitted to having committed the offence he had been charged with. He further submitted that he had agreed to cooperate with the authorities in order to have his future sentence mitigated.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Słubice District Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). The applicant was charged with murder. The bill of indictment comprised several charges brought against three defendants.\n\nThe applicant was tried on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of [DATE_TIME] (the so-called “New Criminal Code”) which entered into force on [DATE_TIME], replacing the Criminal Code of [DATE_TIME] (the so-called “Old Criminal Code”). According to Article 4 of the New Criminal Code, in the event that a case is being examined at a time when the New Criminal Code is in force but concerns an offence which was committed prior to its entry into force, the new law shall nevertheless apply if it is more lenient for the perpetrator (względniejszy dla sprawcy).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court held hearings. The applicant pleaded guilty before the trial court. In particular, he testified that he had committed the murder together with a certain W.B. and a certain A.T.\n\nDuring the trial the authorities further extended the applicant’s detention pending trial on [DATE_TIME] (to [DATE_TIME]). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment. The court noted, inter alia, that although the applicant pleaded guilty, his testimonies had not been fully coherent and contained a number of inconsistencies. It therefore considered that the conditions for the extraordinary mitigation of sentence had not been met in the case.\n\nThe applicant, other co-accused and the District Prosecutor appealed. The applicant’s legal-aid counsel argued that the first-instance court had not mitigated the applicant’s sentence as required by Article 60 § 3 of the New Criminal Code, despite the fact that the applicant had cooperated with the authorities. According to that provision, a domestic court shall mitigate the sentence if the defendant committed the offence with accomplices, and revealed to the prosecution information about the persons involved in the commission of the offence and any significant circumstances in which the offence was committed.\n\nThe applicant was kept in detention pending appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) heard the appeals. It quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for retrial. The appellate court observed at the outset that the appeals lodged by the applicant and the District Prosecutor contested only the severity of the penalty imposed and not the applicant’s guilt which was clearly established. It further considered the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant to be reasonable. However, it found that the evidence examined by the first-instance court had not been sufficient to allow for a definite conclusion as to whether or not the provision on the mitigation of the sentence was applicable in the circumstances of the case, namely whether or not the applicant had disclosed a full and accurate account of events. It further ordered that the applicant’s detention should continue until [DATE_TIME]. The court repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention. In addition, it underlined the need to obtain a report from an expert in graphology.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the trial court held hearings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court convicted the applicant as originally charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment. The other defendants were likewise convicted.\n\nThe applicant, other co-accused and the District Prosecutor appealed. The applicant remained detained pending appeal.\n\nIt appears that the applicant changed his testimony in that he no longer claimed that A.T. had been an accomplice to the offence he had been charged with. He continued to admit his own guilt.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal again quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case for retrial. It ordered that the applicant’s detention should continue until [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the trial court held hearings.\n\nIn the retrial proceedings the applicant made numerous, unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against decisions extending his detention. The relevant decisions on the extension of his detention were given by the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court on [DATE_TIME] (to [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (to [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (to [DATE_TIME]) and on [DATE_TIME] (to [DATE_TIME]).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court convicted the applicant as originally charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. As concerns the other defendants, the court convicted [PERSON] but acquitted A.T.\n\nThe applicant appealed. The applicant’s legal-aid counsel argued, inter alia, that the trial court had erred in that it had not mitigated the applicant’s sentence. The lawyer noted that the material in the case file clearly indicated that the applicant had cooperated with the authorities and therefore had complied with the requirements of Article 60 § 3 of the New Criminal Code. Admittedly, the applicant had changed his pleadings after the judgment of [DATE_TIME]. That, however, should not have had any bearing on the outcome of the case, since the applicant had undoubtedly been coerced into changing his testimony by his co-defendants.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment. It acknowledged that the applicant had given an account of his own wrongdoing. The court observed however that the remainder of his testimony, in particular in part regarding the responsibility of other co-accused had not been credible and had not been taken into consideration by the trial court. The appellate court concluded that the applicant’s testimonies had not been wholly credible and therefore he was not entitled to an extraordinary mitigation of his sentence.\n\nBy letter of [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s legal-aid lawyer informed the Poznań Court of Appeal that he had not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal in the case.\n\nIt appears that throughout the trial the applicant was represented by a lawyer assigned to him under the legal-aid scheme. The applicant submitted that [DATE_TIME] his legal-aid lawyer had never met him to prepare the case and had put forward an ineffective defence.\n\nB. Conditions of the applicant’s detention\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was committed to Międzyrzecz Remand Centre. Since that date he has been continuously detained in several penitentiary facilities. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant was transferred to [LOCATION] where he is currently detained.\n\nThe parties gave partly differing accounts of the conditions of the applicant’s detention.\n\nThe applicant maintained that during most part of his detention he was held in overcrowded cells in conditions which did not comply with the basic standards of hygiene.\n\nThe Government submitted that they could not formally confirm whether during his detention from [DATE_TIME] to [DATE_TIME], from [DATE_TIME], from [DATE_TIME], from [DATE_TIME], from [DATE_TIME], from [DATE_TIME] and from [DATE_TIME] to [DATE_TIME] the applicant was detained in cells with a surface area of at least 3 m² per person. The Government further submitted that the period of the applicant’s detention in cells in which the statutory minimum requirement of 3 m² per person had not been respected amounted to [DATE_TIME]. Finally, they maintained that the applicant was currently detained in a cell in which the statutory minimum requirement of 3 m² per person was respected. This submission was not contested by the applicant.\n\nAt the beginning of his detention the applicant lodged numerous complaints with the penitentiary authorities regarding the conditions of his detention. He submitted that he had later given up as his complaints had no prospects of success and he had feared being persecuted by the prison authorities. The applicant did not bring a civil action in tort to seek compensation for the infringement of his personal rights.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 75107/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jacek Dombek (“the applicant”), on 10 October 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 25 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning alleged unlawfulness and length of the applicant’s detention on remand to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Gdańsk.\n\n1. First set of criminal proceedings (“the Bydgoszcz case”)\n\nOn 9 July 1996 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. On 12 August 1996 the Kędzierzyn-Koźle District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) released the applicant.\n\nOn 20 October 1997 the applicant was again arrested by the police in connection with the same criminal investigation. On 21 October 1997 the Częstochowa District Court decided to detain him on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed several offences acting in an organised group of criminals.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) on 6 November 1997. The appeal lodged by his lawyer was dismissed on 20 November 1997.\n\nOn 8 December 1997 the Częstochowa Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s pre‑trial detention reiterating the grounds originally given for his detention and adding that the measure was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nOn 4 March 1998 the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) further prolonged his detention on remand. That decision was upheld by the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) on 24 April 1998.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Katowice Court of Appeal on 8 July 1998. The court considered that the severity of the anticipated penalty and the risk of collusion justified keeping him in detention.\n\nOn 11 September 1998 the Supreme Court allowed an application made by the Prosecutor General under Article 263 of the 1997 Code of Criminal Procedure (“1997 Code”) and further prolonged the applicant’s detention on remand. The Supreme Court considered that the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences in question and the risk of collusion justified keeping the applicant in detention to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court also considered that the investigation could not be terminated earlier due to circumstances for which the authorities could not be held responsible, such as the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the offences.\n\nOn 31 December 1998 the applicant and 14 co‑accused were indicted before the Bydgoszcz Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nOn 11 January 1999 the Częstochowa Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until 30 June 1999 reiterating the grounds previously given for the applicant’s detention.\n\nOn 23 June 1999 the Bygodszcz Regional Court decided to prolong until 30 September 1999 the applicant’s detention on remand. It considered, for the same reasons as previously given, that keeping the applicant in detention was the only means to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe applicant’s trial started on 24 August 1999 and continued for three days. It appears that the hearing was subsequently adjourned.\n\nOn 27 August 1999 the Bygdoszcz Regional Court examined the applicant’s appeal against its decision of 23 June 1999 and partly allowed it. The court considered that the pre-trial detention of the applicant should be prolonged only until 17 September 1999. It established that in assessing the length of the applicant’s detention with respect to the present case, and for the purpose of the time-limits provided for by Article 263 of the 1997 Code, the period between 9 July and 12 August 1996 should have been added. Accordingly, the Regional Court applied to the Supreme Court asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond the term of two years provided for in Article 263 § 3 of the 1997 Code.\n\nOn 16 September 1999 the Bydgoszcz Detention Centre asked the Supreme Court whether any decision had been given in the applicant’s case. On the same date the President of Chamber III of the Supreme Court informed the Detention Centre by fax that a session on prolongation of the applicant’s detention had been scheduled for 1 October 1999. The President further noted that on the basis of the transitional provisions in the 1997 Code, the applicant’s detention should be ipso jure prolonged until the date of the Supreme Court’s session.\n\nOn 22 September 1999 the applicant’s lawyer submitted pleadings to the Supreme Court in which he argued that the applicant had been illegally detained as the detention order given on 27 August 1999 had expired on 17 September 1999 and therefore he should have been released. In particular, he maintained that the transitional provisions were not applicable in the applicant’s case and that the 1997 Code did not contain a provision which would allow detention on the basis of a fax sent by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 1 October 1999 the Supreme Court held its session and prolonged the applicant’s detention until 27 February 2000 relying on the strong suspicion against the applicant, the complexity of the case and the need to continue the process of gathering the evidence.\n\nOn 10 February and 24 May 2000 the Supreme Court further prolonged the applicant’s detention reiterating the grounds previously given. In the first of those decisions the Supreme Court added: “...There is no evidence that could prove [the applicant’s] assertion that his wife and children ‘would soon have nothing to eat’. Moreover, it should be noted that there is a particular reason why the pre-trial detention of [the applicant] should not be lifted. From the information obtained by the Presiding Judge it appears that [the applicant] might obstruct the proceedings.”\n\nSubsequently, the Bydgoszcz Regional Court made several applications to the Court of Appeal asking that the applicant’s detention be prolonged as, following an amendment to the 1997 Code, the Supreme Court was no longer competent to prolong the detention beyond the statutory time-limit of 2 years, as laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code.\n\nOn 27 September 2000 the Gdansk Court of Appeal granted the application and prolonged the applicant’s detention on remand until 30 December 2000. The court relied in particular on the complexity of the case and the conduct of the accused who had contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings. The court found as follows: “Of course, the applicant’s detention for over three years in this case requires particular attention to be given to the process of gathering evidence, above all, to examine without further delay the defence motions concerning evidence. However, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the conduct of the Regional Courts should be assessed positively”.\n\nOn 21 December 2000 as well as on 25 April and 20 June 2001 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention. In addition to the strong probability that he had committed the offences, the court found that the proceedings had been conducted diligently and concluded that only the applicant’s detention would guarantee the proper conduct of the final stage of the proceedings.\n\nBetween 15 February and 15 October 2001 the applicant served a prison sentence ordered by the Inowrocław District Court in another set of criminal proceedings brought against him.\n\nDuring his pre‑trial detention the applicant lodged several hundred applications for release. However, these applications and his appeals against the decisions to prolong his detention on remand were to no avail.\n\nOn 27 September 2001 the Bydgoszcz Regional Court gave judgment. The trial court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. The applicant and the prosecutor appealed.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s detention with respect to this set of criminal proceedings was not prolonged. However, the applicant had not been released as he remained in pre-trial detention ordered in the second set of criminal proceedings (see below).\n\nOn 17 June 2003 the Gdansk Court of Appeal allowed the appeals and quashed the impugned judgment. The case was remitted to the Bydgoszcz Regional Court which, on 14 January 2004, stayed the proceedings because the other set of criminal proceedings before the Zielona Góra Regional Court were pending and the applicant could not be transported to the Bygdoszcz Detention Centre.\n\nOn 25 May 2005 the Bydgoszcz Regional Court resumed the proceedings. The proceedings are pending before that court.\n\n2. Second set of criminal proceedings (“the Zielona Góra case”)\n\nOn 11 September 1991 the applicant was arrested by the police in connection with criminal proceedings pending against him. On the same date the Zielona Góra Regional Prosecutor decided to detain him on remand.\n\nOn 12 July 1994 the Zielona Góra Regional Court acquitted the applicant.\n\nOn 14 December 1994 the applicant was released from detention.\n\nOn 24 January 1996 the Poznań Court of Appeal quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Prosecutor.\n\nBetween December 1997 and November 1999 the prosecutor stayed the proceedings.\n\nOn 30 January 2001 the Poznań Court of Appeal decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed, with an accomplice, a robbery and three offences of homicide.\n\nThe applicant appealed, but on 13 January 2001 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.\n\nOn 19 April, 24 July and 25 October 2001 and 24 April, 23 July and 24 October 2002 as well as on 22 January 2003 the Poznań Court of Appeal further prolonged his detention. The court held that the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, the severity of the anticipated sentence and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation justified keeping the applicant in detention.\n\nOn 13 March 2003 the applicant was indicted before the Zielona Góra Regional Court.\n\nOn 26 March 2003 the Poznań Court of Appeal further prolonged the applicant’s detention. Subsequently, the applicant’s detention was prolonged on three occasions in 2003, and on 25 March, 24 June, 23 September and 21 December 2004. The court in all those decisions found that the grounds for keeping him in detention were still valid.\n\nOn 28 April 2005 the trial court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to twenty-five years’ imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant requested that the written reasons for the judgment be prepared by the trial court so as to allow him to lodge an appeal.",

Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\n1. First set of criminal proceedings (“the [PERSON] case”)\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. On [DATE_TIME] the Kędzierzyn-Koźle District Court ([PERSON]) released the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was again arrested by the police in connection with the same criminal investigation. On [DATE_TIME] the Częstochowa District Court decided to detain him on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed several offences acting in an organised group of criminals.\n\nThe applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Częstochowa Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) on [DATE_TIME]. The appeal lodged by his lawyer was dismissed on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Częstochowa Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s pre‑trial detention reiterating the grounds originally given for his detention and adding that the measure was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) further prolonged his detention on remand. That decision was upheld by the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) on [DATE_TIME].\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s detention was prolonged by the Katowice Court of Appeal on [DATE_TIME]. The court considered that the severity of the anticipated penalty and the risk of collusion justified keeping him in detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court allowed an application made by the Prosecutor General under Article 263 of the 1997 Code of Criminal Procedure (“[DATE_TIME] Code”) and further prolonged the applicant’s detention on remand. The Supreme Court considered that the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences in question and the risk of collusion justified keeping the applicant in detention to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court also considered that the investigation could not be terminated earlier due to circumstances for which the authorities could not be held responsible, such as the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the offences.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant and 14 co‑accused were indicted before the Bydgoszcz Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Częstochowa Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME] reiterating the grounds previously given for the applicant’s detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bygodszcz Regional Court decided to prolong until [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s detention on remand. It considered, for the same reasons as previously given, that keeping the applicant in detention was the only means to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe applicant’s trial started on [DATE_TIME] and continued for [DATE_TIME]. It appears that the hearing was subsequently adjourned.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bygdoszcz Regional Court examined the applicant’s appeal against its decision of [DATE_TIME] and partly allowed it. The court considered that the pre-trial detention of the applicant should be prolonged only until [DATE_TIME]. It established that in assessing the length of the applicant’s detention with respect to the present case, and for the purpose of the time-limits provided for by Article 263 of the 1997 Code, the period between [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] should have been added. Accordingly, the Regional Court applied to the Supreme Court asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond the term of [DATE_TIME] provided for in Article 263 § 3 of the 1997 Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bydgoszcz Detention Centre asked the Supreme Court whether any decision had been given in the applicant’s case. On the same date the President of [PERSON] of the Supreme Court informed [LOCATION] by fax that a session on prolongation of the applicant’s detention had been scheduled for [DATE_TIME]. The President further noted that on the basis of the transitional provisions in the [DATE_TIME] Code, the applicant’s detention should be ipso jure prolonged until the date of the Supreme Court’s session.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant’s lawyer submitted pleadings to the Supreme Court in which he argued that the applicant had been illegally detained as the detention order given on [DATE_TIME] had expired on [DATE_TIME] and therefore he should have been released. In particular, he maintained that the transitional provisions were not applicable in the applicant’s case and that the [DATE_TIME] Code did not contain a provision which would allow detention on the basis of a fax sent by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court held its session and prolonged the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME] relying on the strong suspicion against the applicant, the complexity of the case and the need to continue the process of gathering the evidence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court further prolonged the applicant’s detention reiterating the grounds previously given. In the first of those decisions the Supreme Court added: “[URL]ere is no evidence that could prove [the applicant’s] assertion that his wife and children ‘would soon have nothing to eat’. Moreover, it should be noted that there is a particular reason why the pre-trial detention of [the applicant] should not be lifted. From the information obtained by the Presiding Judge it appears that [the applicant] might obstruct the proceedings.”\n\nSubsequently, the Bydgoszcz Regional Court made several applications to the Court of Appeal asking that the applicant’s detention be prolonged as, following an amendment to the 1997 Code, the Supreme Court was no longer competent to prolong the detention beyond the statutory time-limit of [DATE_TIME], as laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdansk Court of Appeal granted the application and prolonged the applicant’s detention on remand until [DATE_TIME]. The court relied in particular on the complexity of the case and the conduct of the accused who had contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings. The court found as follows: “Of course, the applicant’s detention for [DATE_TIME] in this case requires particular attention to be given to the process of gathering evidence, above all, to examine without further delay the defence motions concerning evidence. However, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the conduct of the Regional Courts should be assessed positively”.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] as well as on [DATE_TIME] the Gdańsk Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention. In addition to the strong probability that he had committed the offences, the court found that the proceedings had been conducted diligently and concluded that only the applicant’s detention would guarantee the proper conduct of the final stage of the proceedings.\n\n[DATE_TIME] the applicant served a prison sentence ordered by the Inowrocław District Court in another set of criminal proceedings brought against him.\n\nDuring his pre‑trial detention the applicant lodged several hundred applications for release. However, these applications and his appeals against the decisions to prolong his detention on remand were to no avail.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bydgoszcz Regional Court gave judgment. The trial court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant and the prosecutor appealed.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s detention with respect to this set of criminal proceedings was not prolonged. However, the applicant had not been released as he remained in pre-trial detention ordered in the second set of criminal proceedings (see below).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Gdansk Court of Appeal allowed the appeals and quashed the impugned judgment. The case was remitted to the Bydgoszcz Regional Court which, on [DATE_TIME], stayed the proceedings because the other set of criminal proceedings before the Zielona Góra Regional Court were pending and the applicant could not be transported to the Bygdoszcz Detention Centre.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bydgoszcz Regional Court resumed the proceedings. The proceedings are pending before that court.\n\n2. Second set of criminal proceedings (“the Zielona Góra case”)\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested by the police in connection with criminal proceedings pending against him. On the same date the Zielona Góra Regional Prosecutor decided to detain him on remand.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Zielona Góra Regional Court acquitted the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released from detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Prosecutor.\n\n[DATE_TIME] the prosecutor stayed the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed, with an accomplice, a robbery and three offences of homicide.\n\nThe applicant appealed, but on [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] as well as on [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal further prolonged his detention. The court held that the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, the severity of the anticipated sentence and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation justified keeping the applicant in detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was indicted before the Zielona Góra Regional Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Poznań Court of Appeal further prolonged the applicant’s detention. Subsequently, the applicant’s detention was prolonged on three occasions in [DATE_TIME], and on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The court in all those decisions found that the grounds for keeping him in detention were still valid.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant requested that the written reasons for the judgment be prepared by the trial court so as to allow him to lodge an appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18390/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Nowak (“the applicant”), on 11 April 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 January 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President of the Chamber also decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the cases of Michalak v. Poland and Owczar v. Poland (applications nos. 16864/02 and 34117/02) (Rule 42 § 2 of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Brzeg.\n\nOn 21 May 1999 the Brzeg District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) issued a “wanted” notice in respect of the applicant and several other men in connection with an investigation into allegations made by six women, some of whom were minors, that a group of several men had raped them, threatened them, beaten them and forced them to take drugs. The warrant for arrest was issued after the prosecution service had established that the applicant had gone into hiding and the police had unsuccessfully attempted to arrest him.\n\nOn 21 July 1999 the police attempted to arrest the applicant. However he managed to escape trying in the process to run over police officers while driving away. Two other men sought under the arrest warrant issued in connection with the same investigation were apprehended and arrested.\n\nOn 9 August 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police. At the time of arrest he was in possession of a firearm and a forged identification document. On 13 August 1999 the Opole District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the following offences: repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty while acting in an organised criminal gang; leading an organised gang; supplying minor victims with drugs; forging an identification document; and destroying a police car. The court also found that, given that he had absconded in the past, there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding again and try to influence the victims.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision ordering his detention on remand but his appeal was dismissed on 3 September 1999 by the Opole Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the Opole Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention relying on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences and on the complexity of the investigation which had not yet been terminated by the prosecutor.\n\nOn 13 December 1999 the court decided that the applicant's detention should be prolonged. It considered that, in addition to the strong suspicion against the applicant, the severity of the sentence that might be imposed and the risk of his tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses justified holding him in custody. In addition, the court relied on the risk that, given that he had absconded in the past, he might go into hiding again. The court also observed that only detention on remand would secure the applicant's appearance at the trial.\n\nOn 16 December 1999 the applicant was indicted before the Opole Regional Court. It appears that the first hearing was held on 26 April 2000. In 2000 the trial court held in total 13 hearings.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant's detention was prolonged by decisions of 12 June and 13 November 2000 and 15 May 2001. The decisions were based on the reasons given for his detention on previous occasions.\n\nAfterwards, as the length of the applicant's detention had reached the statutory time‑limit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) asking for the applicant's detention to be prolonged beyond that term. On 28 June 2001 the Wrocław Court of Appeal allowed the application and prolonged his pre‑trial detention. The Court of Appeal based its decision on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences and on the risk that he might interfere with the course of justice. The court further considered that the complexity of the case constituted a special circumstance justifying his remaining in custody.\n\nOn 7 November 2001 the Wrocław Court of Appeal again decided to prolong the pre-trial detention of the applicant, finding that the initial reasons for the detention were still valid. Furthermore, the court examined the course of the proceedings before the Opole Regional Court and agreed that the case was particularly complex and time-consuming, given the number of accused and the considerable amount of evidence which had to be examined. It considered that the trial court had acted diligently as it had taken evidence from nineteen witnesses during the last seven hearings.\n\nOn 13 February 2002 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until 15 May 2002. The court noted that the applicant had been detained on remand for a long time. However, it considered that the particular circumstances of the case justified keeping him in custody until 15 May 2002 by which time the trial should have been completed.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court again applied to prolong the applicant's detention. On 8 May 2002 the Court of Appeal granted the application. However, it criticised the Regional Court for the delay in the case and requested the trial court “to take adequate and more intensive action to finish the trial”. The court further took into account that the accused were partly responsible for the length of the proceedings because they had lodged vexatious applications for new evidence to be heard and had not complied with time-limits for filing new submissions.\n\nThe applicant's numerous applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail.\n\nThe Opole Regional Court held 23 hearings in 2001 and 21 hearings in 2002. On 31 July 2002 the Opole Regional Court gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of several counts of repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment committed while acting in an organised criminal gang. The applicant was also convicted of administering an unknown psychotropic substance to some of the victims and use of a forged identity document. The court acquitted the applicant of being the leader of the organised criminal gang. The applicant was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. The applicant and other co‑accused appealed.\n\nOn 2 June 2003 the Wrocław Court of Appeal gave a judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment with respect to the applicant reducing his prison sentence to 10 years and 8 months. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nOn 11 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18390/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President of the Chamber also decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the cases of [NRP] v. [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] v. [LOCATION] (applications nos. [PHONE_NUMBER] and 34117/02) (Rule 42 § 2 of the Rules of Court).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Brzeg District Court ([PERSON]) issued a “wanted” notice in respect of the applicant and several other men in connection with an investigation into allegations made by six women, some of whom were minors, that a group of several men had raped them, threatened them, beaten them and forced them to take drugs. The warrant for arrest was issued after the prosecution service had established that the applicant had gone into hiding and the police had unsuccessfully attempted to arrest him.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the police attempted to arrest the applicant. However he managed to escape trying in the process to run over police officers while driving away. Two other men sought under the arrest warrant issued in connection with the same investigation were apprehended and arrested.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested by the police. At the time of arrest he was in possession of a firearm and a forged identification document. On [DATE_TIME] the Opole District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the following offences: repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty while acting in an organised criminal gang; leading an organised gang; supplying minor victims with drugs; forging an identification document; and destroying a police car. The court also found that, given that he had absconded in the past, there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding again and try to influence the victims.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision ordering his detention on remand but his appeal was dismissed on [DATE_TIME] by the Opole Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Opole Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention relying on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences and on the complexity of the investigation which had not yet been terminated by the prosecutor.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court decided that the applicant's detention should be prolonged. It considered that, in addition to the strong suspicion against the applicant, the severity of the sentence that might be imposed and the risk of his tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses justified holding him in custody. In addition, the court relied on the risk that, given that he had absconded in the past, he might go into hiding again. The court also observed that only detention on remand would secure the applicant's appearance at the trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was indicted before the Opole Regional Court. It appears that the first hearing was held on [DATE_TIME]. In [DATE_TIME] the trial court held in total 13 hearings.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant's detention was prolonged by decisions of [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The decisions were based on the reasons given for his detention on previous occasions.\n\nAfterwards, as the length of the applicant's detention had reached the statutory time‑limit of [DATE_TIME] laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ([PERSON] postępowania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Wrocław Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) asking for the applicant's detention to be prolonged beyond that term. On [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal allowed the application and prolonged his pre‑trial detention. The Court of Appeal based its decision on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences and on the risk that he might interfere with the course of justice. The court further considered that the complexity of the case constituted a special circumstance justifying his remaining in custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal again decided to prolong the pre-trial detention of the applicant, finding that the initial reasons for the detention were still valid. Furthermore, the court examined the course of the proceedings before the Opole Regional Court and agreed that the case was particularly complex and time-consuming, given the number of accused and the considerable amount of evidence which had to be examined. It considered that the trial court had acted diligently as it had taken evidence from nineteen witnesses during the last seven hearings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. The court noted that the applicant had been detained on remand for a long time. However, it considered that the particular circumstances of the case justified keeping him in custody until [DATE_TIME] by which time the trial should have been completed.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court again applied to prolong the applicant's detention. On [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal granted the application. However, it criticised the Regional Court for the delay in the case and requested the trial court “to take adequate and more intensive action to finish the trial”. The court further took into account that the accused were partly responsible for the length of the proceedings because they had lodged vexatious applications for new evidence to be heard and had not complied with time-limits for filing new submissions.\n\nThe applicant's numerous applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail.\n\nThe Opole Regional Court held 23 hearings in [DATE_TIME] and 21 hearings in [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the Opole Regional Court gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of several counts of repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment committed while acting in an organised criminal gang. The applicant was also convicted of administering an unknown psychotropic substance to some of the victims and use of a forged identity document. The court acquitted the applicant of being the leader of the organised criminal gang. The applicant was sentenced to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant and other co‑accused appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal gave a judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment with respect to the applicant reducing his prison sentence to [DATE_TIME]. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28095/08) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Witold Siwiec (“the applicant”), on 14 May 2008.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant complained that he had been unable to present his civil case to the courts on an equitable basis vis-à-vis the opposite party.\n\nOn 11 October 2010 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Zabrze.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2004 the applicant ran a business, a shoe shop, with his wife.\n\nIn October 2004 he started serving a prison sentence.\n\nOn 4 September 2006 he lodged a civil action against his wife with the Łuków District Court, claiming that she should transfer the lease of the shop to him, together with the merchandise which had been left there at the time of his arrest. He also claimed compensation for damage which he had allegedly sustained as a result of her having unlawfully taken over the business after his arrest, in the amount of 2,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) per month since October 2004.\n\nHe further requested exemption from court fees. In the statement of claim he informed the court that his opportunity to represent himself properly had been curtailed by the fact that he was serving a prison sentence.\n\nThe proceedings were conducted under the procedural provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure pertaining to commercial disputes, providing, in particular, for certain restrictions as regards time-limits for proposing evidence to be examined by the first-instance court (prekluzja dowodowa).\n\nOn 20 December 2006 the Lublin Regional Court exempted the applicant from the obligation to pay court fees in the amount of PLN 5,850 but maintained his obligation to pay other court fees as they arose in the future. The court noted that the applicant was poor and did not have any savings which would secure his procedural interests in the proceedings.\n\nOn 22 February 2007 the applicant requested that witness C.O., the owner of the shop, be heard by the court to testify on the lease.\n\nOn 7 May 2007 the court issued a decision dismissing the applicant’s request for the witness C.O. to be heard. The court reiterated that according to Article 47912 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure the applicant’s request had to be refused, as he had failed to submit it with his statement of claim. The court further noted that the requested evidence was of no importance for the case. The decision was sent to the applicant. It was served on him on 30 May 2007.\n\nA date for the hearing was scheduled for 11 June 2007.\n\nBy a letter of 31 May 2007 the applicant requested the court to arrange for him to be brought to the hearing from Biała Podlaska Prison, where he was detained at that time. He also reiterated that witness C.O. should be questioned and requested that K.M. and A.M. also be heard by the court as witnesses. The applicant failed to submit copies of his request to the court as required by Article 128 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 28 below).\n\nOn 11 June 2007 the court requested the applicant to complete his request by submitting copies of it with a view to having them served on the defendant. The applicant failed to comply with the court’s request.\n\nA hearing in the case was held on the same day. It lasted five minutes. The defendant stated only that she did not accept the applicant’s claim. The applicant was neither present nor represented.\n\nThe court gave a judgment on 25 June 2007. It dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding no grounds on which to accept that he had suffered any damage or that the defendant had been acting unlawfully.\n\nIn the written reasons for that judgment the court referred to Article 47912 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 27 below) and held that the applicant’s request for C.O. to be heard as a witness had been submitted too late. It should have been submitted with the statement of claim. The court did not refer to the applicant’s request to be brought to the hearing held on 11 June 2007.\n\nThe applicant appealed. He argued that the first-instance court had assessed the evidence wrongly and reached untenable conclusions. He further submitted that he was serving a prison sentence and that it was therefore very difficult for him to effectively defend his interests in the proceedings. He requested exemption from all court fees and for a legal‑aid lawyer to be assigned to represent him before the appellate court.\n\nBy a decision of 1 October 2007 the Lublin Regional Court refused to grant legal aid to the applicant, finding that he was able to present his own case to the court. The court was of the view that the fact that his claim had been dismissed was not tantamount to a finding that the applicant was unable to argue his case. The court exempted him from the obligation to pay court fees in the amount of PLN 6,750 and dismissed the remainder of his request. It noted that the applicant remained in prison and that his financial situation had not improved since the previous decision on court fees had been given (see paragraph 10 above).\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision in so far as it related to the refusal of legal aid. He submitted that the fact that he was relatively articulate did not suffice for a finding that he was able to prepare and present legal arguments to the appellate court in a sufficiently competent manner. He reiterated that he was serving a prison sentence, which made it difficult for him to act effectively in defence of his interests in the proceedings.\n\nOn 30 October 2007 the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against the refusal to grant legal aid, essentially sharing the views of the first‑instance court. It further noted that the fact that the applicant was serving a prison sentence did not of itself justify assigning a lawyer to the case, because it was not necessary for the applicant to appear in person before the court.\n\nOn 18 December 2007 the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance judgment, essentially sharing the conclusions of the first‑instance court. The court accepted that the case concerned a commercial dispute and was therefore governed by the more strict regulations of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the written grounds for the judgment the court relied on the parties’ statements of claims and on the defendant’s statements made before the court.\n\nThis judgment was served on the applicant on 29 January 2008.\n\nOn 6 February 2008 the Lublin Court of Appeal granted the applicant legal aid for the purposes of preparing a cassation appeal. On 11 February 2008 the Lublin Bar Association assigned M. K. to the case.\n\nBy a written legal opinion dated 25 February 2008 the lawyer informed the applicant that he was refusing to prepare a cassation appeal in the case. He was of the view that there were no legal grounds on which such an appeal could be prepared. This opinion was served on the applicant shortly afterwards.",

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nFrom [DATE_TIME] until [DATE_TIME] the applicant ran a business, a shoe shop, with his wife.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] he started serving a prison sentence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] he lodged a civil action against his wife with the Łuków District Court, claiming that she should transfer the lease of the shop to him, together with the merchandise which had been left there at the time of his arrest. He also claimed compensation for damage which he had allegedly sustained as a result of her having unlawfully taken over the business after his arrest, in the amount of 2,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) per month since [DATE_TIME].\n\nHe further requested exemption from court fees. In the statement of claim he informed the court that his opportunity to represent himself properly had been curtailed by the fact that he was serving a prison sentence.\n\nThe proceedings were conducted under the procedural provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure pertaining to commercial disputes, providing, in particular, for certain restrictions as regards time-limits for proposing evidence to be examined by the first-instance court (prekluzja dowodowa).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Regional Court exempted the applicant from the obligation to pay court fees in the amount of PLN 5,850 but maintained his obligation to pay other court fees as they arose in the future. The court noted that the applicant was poor and did not have any savings which would secure his procedural interests in the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant requested that witness [PERSON], the owner of the shop, be heard by the court to testify on the lease.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court issued a decision dismissing the applicant’s request for the witness [PERSON] to be heard. The court reiterated that according to Article 47912 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure the applicant’s request had to be refused, as he had failed to submit it with his statement of claim. The court further noted that the requested evidence was of no importance for the case. The decision was sent to the applicant. It was served on him on [DATE_TIME].\n\nA date for the hearing was scheduled for [DATE_TIME].\n\nBy a letter of [DATE_TIME] the applicant requested the court to arrange for him to be brought to the hearing from Biała Podlaska Prison, where he was detained at that time. He also reiterated that witness [PERSON] should be questioned and requested that [PERSON] and A.M. also be heard by the court as witnesses. The applicant failed to submit copies of his request to the court as required by Article 128 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 28 below).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court requested the applicant to complete his request by submitting copies of it with a view to having them served on the defendant. The applicant failed to comply with the court’s request.\n\nA hearing in the case was held on [DATE_TIME]. It lasted [DATE_TIME]. The defendant stated only that she did not accept the applicant’s claim. The applicant was neither present nor represented.\n\nThe court gave a judgment on [DATE_TIME]. It dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding no grounds on which to accept that he had suffered any damage or that the defendant had been acting unlawfully.\n\nIn the written reasons for that judgment the court referred to Article 47912 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 27 below) and held that the applicant’s request for [PERSON] to be heard as a witness had been submitted too late. It should have been submitted with the statement of claim. The court did not refer to the applicant’s request to be brought to the hearing held on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant appealed. He argued that the first-instance court had assessed the evidence wrongly and reached untenable conclusions. He further submitted that he was serving a prison sentence and that it was therefore very difficult for him to effectively defend his interests in the proceedings. He requested exemption from all court fees and for a legal‑aid lawyer to be assigned to represent him before the appellate court.\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Regional Court refused to grant legal aid to the applicant, finding that he was able to present his own case to the court. The court was of the view that the fact that his claim had been dismissed was not tantamount to a finding that the applicant was unable to argue his case. The court exempted him from the obligation to pay court fees in the amount of PLN 6,750 and dismissed the remainder of his request. It noted that the applicant remained in prison and that his financial situation had not improved since the previous decision on court fees had been given (see paragraph 10 above).\n\nThe applicant appealed against this decision in so far as it related to the refusal of legal aid. He submitted that the fact that he was relatively articulate did not suffice for a finding that he was able to prepare and present legal arguments to the appellate court in a sufficiently competent manner. He reiterated that he was serving a prison sentence, which made it difficult for him to act effectively in defence of his interests in the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against the refusal to grant legal aid, essentially sharing the views of the first‑instance court. It further noted that the fact that the applicant was serving a prison sentence did not of itself justify assigning a lawyer to the case, because it was not necessary for the applicant to appear in person before the court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance judgment, essentially sharing the conclusions of the first‑instance court. The court accepted that the case concerned a commercial dispute and was therefore governed by the more strict regulations of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the written grounds for the judgment the court relied on the parties’ statements of claims and on the defendant’s statements made before the court.\n\nThis judgment was served on the applicant on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Court of Appeal granted the applicant legal aid for the purposes of preparing a cassation appeal. On [DATE_TIME] the Lublin Bar Association assigned [PERSON] to the case.\n\nBy a written legal opinion dated [DATE_TIME] the lawyer informed the applicant that he was refusing to prepare a cassation appeal in the case. He was of the view that there were no legal grounds on which such an appeal could be prepared. This opinion was served on the applicant shortly afterwards.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39595/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Jarosław Jakubiak (“the applicant”), on 23 September 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Wiesław Bielawski, a lawyer practising in Wałbrzych. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 6 June 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Jelenia Góra.\n\nOn 10 June 1999 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 12 June 1999 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the seriousness of the charges against him and the risk that he might tamper with evidence or go into hiding.\n\nOn 2 September 1999 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until 30 September 1999. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. The court made reference to the measures already taken in the investigation and indicated, in detail, the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was necessary to extend the applicant’s detention. The court also referred to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case.\n\nOn 28 September 1999 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 10 December 1999. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nOn 7 December 1999 the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention until 31 December 1999. On 28 December 1999 it extended that period until 15 January 2000. It emphasised that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid.\n\nOn 14 January 2000 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 June 2000. It repeated the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions and added that further detention would not be excessively burdensome for the applicant or his family.\n\nOn 5 June, 19 June and 11 December 2000 and 9 April 2001 the court held hearings.\n\nOn 19 June, 11 December 2000 and 9 April 2001 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention. It repeated the grounds previously given for keeping him in custody.\n\nOn 21 May 2001 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court applied under Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings to the Wrocław Court of Appeal for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond the statutory time-limit of two years. On 29 May 2001 the Wrocław Court of Appeal granted the request and extended the applicant’s detention until 20 September 2001. It held that there was a strong suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and that the nature of the offences justified the continuation of his detention. In addition, it stressed that the case was particularly complex.\n\nOn 20 September 2001 the Wrocław Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 November 2001. It repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nOn 4 October 2001 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twenty-five years’ imprisonment. He appealed. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on four occasions.\n\nOn 12 September 2002 the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. At the same time the Court of Appeal extended his detention.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On 3 December 2003 the Supreme Court allowed the cassation appeal, quashed the appellate court’s judgment and remitted the case to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 3 December 2003 the Supreme Court extended the applicant’s detention until 3 April 2004, relying on the seriousness of the charges, the “degree of danger to society” (stopień społecznej szkodliwości) represented by the offence in question and the severity of the penalty imposed by the court of first instance.\n\nOn 5 March 2004 the Wrocław Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Jelenia Góra Regional Court. The court stated that the failure to call and hear evidence from six eyewitnesses, Belarus nationals, had been a serious shortcoming justifying a retrial. The trial court had not made efforts to secure their presence at the hearing or to make use of a rogatory letter in order to have them heard as witnesses by the Belarus authorities. Furthermore, as regards the anonymous witness, the court of first instance had failed to make efforts to secure his presence at the hearing. The court had not made sufficient inquiries about his whereabouts.\n\nOn 1 April and 23 September 2004 and 24 March 2005 the Wrocław Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. It referred to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and found that holding him in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the proceedings the applicant made repeated unsuccessful applications for release. He also appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against refusals to release him and decisions extending his detention.\n\nAt a hearing held on 1 March 2005 the Regional Court decided to send a rogatory letter to the relevant Belarusian court, asking it to take evidence from six eyewitnesses. The applicant’s lawyer prepared questions in writing to be put to them on the applicant’s behalf. The court in Belarus heard evidence from three witnesses, because, despite the efforts of the authorities, it was impossible for them to establish the current addresses of the remaining witnesses. The records of evidence taken from those witnesses during the investigation were read out by the trial court.\n\nOn 8 March 2006 the Jelenia Góra Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The court established the facts of the case on the basis of evidence taken from seventeen witnesses.\n\nThe applicant appealed. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on several occasions.\n\nOn 28 September 2006 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It considered that the facts of the case had been duly established and the rules of criminal procedure, as well as guarantees of a fair trial, had been respected. As regards evidence from the anonymous witness, despite the authorities’ efforts, the court could not secure his presence at the hearing. Consequently, it was necessary to take into account evidence given by him in the investigation.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On 19 December 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39595/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [PERSON].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court ([PERSON]) remanded him in custody. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the seriousness of the charges against him and the risk that he might tamper with evidence or go into hiding.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. The court made reference to the measures already taken in the investigation and indicated, in detail, the evidence that still had to be taken. Consequently, it decided that it was necessary to extend the applicant’s detention. The court also referred to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and the complexity of the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] it extended that period until [DATE_TIME]. It emphasised that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It repeated the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions and added that further detention would not be excessively burdensome for the applicant or his family.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the court held hearings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention. It repeated the grounds previously given for keeping him in custody.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court applied under Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings to the Wrocław Court of Appeal for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond the statutory time-limit of [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal granted the request and extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It held that there was a strong suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and that the nature of the offences justified the continuation of his detention. In addition, it stressed that the case was particularly complex.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. He appealed. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on four occasions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. At the same time the Court of Appeal extended his detention.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court allowed the cassation appeal, quashed the appellate court’s judgment and remitted the case to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME], relying on the seriousness of the charges, the “degree of danger to society” (stopień społecznej szkodliwości) represented by the offence in question and the severity of the penalty imposed by the court of first instance.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Jelenia Góra Regional Court. The court stated that the failure to call and hear evidence from six eyewitnesses, [LOCATION] nationals, had been a serious shortcoming justifying a retrial. The trial court had not made efforts to secure their presence at the hearing or to make use of a rogatory letter in order to have them heard as witnesses by the [LOCATION] authorities. Furthermore, as regards the anonymous witness, the court of first instance had failed to make efforts to secure his presence at the hearing. The court had not made sufficient inquiries about his whereabouts.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] 23 September 2004 and [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. It referred to the likelihood of a lengthy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant and found that holding him in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the proceedings the applicant made repeated unsuccessful applications for release. He also appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against refusals to release him and decisions extending his detention.\n\nAt a hearing held on [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court decided to send a rogatory letter to the relevant [NRP] court, asking it to take evidence from six eyewitnesses. The applicant’s lawyer prepared questions in writing to be put to them on the applicant’s behalf. The court in [LOCATION] heard evidence from three witnesses, because, despite the efforts of the authorities, it was impossible for them to establish the current addresses of the remaining witnesses. The records of evidence taken from those witnesses during the investigation were read out by the trial court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Jelenia Góra Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME]’ imprisonment. The court established the facts of the case on the basis of evidence taken from seventeen witnesses.\n\nThe applicant appealed. The applicant’s detention was subsequently extended on several occasions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It considered that the facts of the case had been duly established and the rules of criminal procedure, as well as guarantees of a fair trial, had been respected. As regards evidence from the anonymous witness, despite the authorities’ efforts, the court could not secure his presence at the hearing. Consequently, it was necessary to take into account evidence given by him in the investigation.\n\nThe applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 15476/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Artur Bystrowski (“the applicant”), on 26 November 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant mainly complained under Articles 3 and 5 § 3 of the Convention of the inadequate conditions and the unreasonable length of his pre-trial detention.\n\nOn 20070831 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE CASE\n\nA. The circumstances of the case\n\nThe applicant, Mr Artur Bystrowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1963 and lives in Strzelin.\n\n1. The applicant’s pre-trial detention and criminal proceedings against him\n\nOn 8 September 2000 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) detained the applicant on remand on suspicion of having committed theft and forgery and of leadership of an organised criminal gang.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended on several occasions. In successive decisions, given on 29 November 2000, 15 February and 7 December 2001, 23 August and 2 October 2002, the court repeatedly relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and that there was a real risk that he would receive a severe sentence. This – together with the fact that he had acted in a gang and that there were several co-accused in the case –gave rise to a presumption that he would obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings.\n\nIn the meantime, on 9 February 2001 a bill of indictment was issued, charging the applicant with multiple theft, forgery, possession of a firearm without a licence and leadership of an organised criminal gang.\n\nThe first court’s hearing took place on 6 April 2001. Subsequently, nine sessions were scheduled in 2001; eighteen in 2002; sixteen in 2003; and eleven in 2004. In 2001 the trial court heard testimonies of thirty-four witnesses; in 2002 - of forty-six; in 2003 – of five; and in 2004 of four. The court also examined other voluminous evidence and considered various procedural motions filed by the applicant and other co-defendants.\n\nAs the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory 2-year time-limit laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) applied to the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) asking for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond that period. On 20 November and 6 December 2002 and 5 March 2003 the Court of Appeal granted the applications, finding that the grounds previously given for the detention on remand were still valid and that the use of the most severe preventive measure was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nThe applicant challenged his detention on remand. He lodged appeals against the Wrocław Regional Court’s decisions of 15 February 2001, 4 September 2002 and 5 March 2003. His appeals were dismissed by decisions of the Wrocław Court of Appeal of 23 March 2001, 2 October 2002 and 26 March 2003, respectively.\n\nHe also lodged numerous requests for release from detention, which were dismissed by the Wrocław Regional Court’s decisions of 7 December 2001, 28 June and 8 August 2002.\n\nFurther, he also requested the application of a more lenient preventive measure in place of detention on remand. The request was dismissed by the Wrocław District Prosecutor’s decision of 18 October 2000.\n\nBy a decision of the Wrocław Regional Court of 29 April 2003 the applicant was released from detention.\n\nOn 21 September 2004 the Wrocław Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn an unspecified date, presumably in 2008 the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time with the domestic court, under the Law of 17 June 2004 (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\n2. Restrictions on the applicant’s right of visit during his detention\n\nDuring the detention, the applicant’s requests for visits from his wife were rejected on 23 February, 2 March and 30 April 2001. As stated in the decisions of the Wrocław Regional Court of 2 March and 30 April 2001 this was due to the fact that the wife was a witness in the applicant’s case.\n\n3. Monitoring of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nThe applicant further submitted that during his pre-trial detention his correspondence with the Court had been censored. To that effect the applicant supplied an envelope of a letter from the Registry of 12 March 2003 bearing a stamp “censored” (ocenzurowano), a date “21 March 2003” and an illegible signature.\n\n4. The conditions of the applicant’s detention\n\nIn his letters to the Court of 21 February and 23 June 2002 and 23 November 2005, the applicant complained about the conditions of his detention in Wrocław Remand Centre.\n\nHe alleged in particular that he was detained with six other persons in a room measuring 16m2; he could only take walks in a closed area measuring 20m2 for 25 persons; there was no warm water available and the ventilation and sanitation were insufficient.\n\nThe applicant complained to the detention centre’s authorities about those conditions, however to no avail. He also claimed that if he were to complain to higher authorities he would run a risk of harassment by the guards, given that his correspondence had been censored.\n\nB. Relevant domestic law and practice\n\n1. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n\nThe relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre‑trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27‑33, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22‑23, 4 August 2006.\n\n2. General rules concerning conditions of detention\n\nThe relevant law and practice pertaining to conditions of detention and to civil law action for compensation against the State Treasury are laid out in the judgment in the case of Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, §§ 64-75.\n\n3. Detainees’ correspondence and contact with family\n\nThe legal provisions concerning monitoring of detainees’ correspondence applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs 65-66 of the judgment delivered by the Court on 4 May 2006 in Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning detainees’ right to receive visitors in remand centres are stated in the Court’s judgment in the case of Gradek v. Poland, no. 39631/06, §§ 21-25, 8 June 2010.\n\n4. Remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings\n\nThe relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland, no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V; Ratajczyk v. Poland, no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII; and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 15476/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant mainly complained under Articles 3 and 5 § 3 of the Convention of the inadequate conditions and the unreasonable length of his pre-trial detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE CASE\n\nA. The circumstances of the case\n\nThe applicant, Mr [PERSON], is a [NRP] national who was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in Strzelin.\n\n1. The applicant’s pre-trial detention and criminal proceedings against him\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court ([PERSON]) detained the applicant on remand on suspicion of having committed theft and forgery and of leadership of an organised criminal gang.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended on several occasions. In successive decisions, given on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the court repeatedly relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and that there was a real risk that he would receive a severe sentence. This – together with the fact that he had acted in a gang and that there were several co-accused in the case –gave rise to a presumption that he would obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings.\n\nIn the meantime, on [DATE_TIME] a bill of indictment was issued, charging the applicant with multiple theft, forgery, possession of a firearm without a licence and leadership of an organised criminal gang.\n\nThe first court’s hearing took place on [DATE_TIME]. Subsequently, nine sessions were scheduled in [DATE_TIME]; eighteen in [DATE_TIME]; sixteen in [DATE_TIME]; and eleven in [DATE_TIME]. In [DATE_TIME] the trial court heard testimonies of thirty-four witnesses; in [DATE_TIME]; in [DATE_TIME] – of five; and in [DATE_TIME] of four. The court also examined other voluminous evidence and considered various procedural motions filed by the applicant and other co-defendants.\n\nAs the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory [DATE_TIME] time-limit laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) applied to the Wrocław Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) asking for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond that period. On [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal granted the applications, finding that the grounds previously given for the detention on remand were still valid and that the use of the most severe preventive measure was necessary to ensure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nThe applicant challenged his detention on remand. He lodged appeals against the Wrocław Regional Court’s decisions of [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. His appeals were dismissed by decisions of the Wrocław Court of Appeal of [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], respectively.\n\nHe also lodged numerous requests for release from detention, which were dismissed by the Wrocław Regional Court’s decisions of [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME].\n\nFurther, he also requested the application of a more lenient preventive measure in place of detention on remand. The request was dismissed by the Wrocław District Prosecutor’s decision of [DATE_TIME].\n\nBy a decision of the Wrocław Regional Court of [DATE_TIME] the applicant was released from detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn an unspecified date, presumably in [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a complaint about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time with the domestic court, under the Law of [DATE_TIME] ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\n2. Restrictions on the applicant’s right of visit during his detention\n\nDuring the detention, the applicant’s requests for visits from his wife were rejected on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. As stated in the decisions of the Wrocław Regional Court of [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] this was due to the fact that the wife was a witness in the applicant’s case.\n\n3. Monitoring of the applicant’s correspondence\n\nThe applicant further submitted that during his pre-trial detention his correspondence with the Court had been censored. To that effect the applicant supplied an envelope of a letter from the Registry of 12 March 2003 bearing a stamp “censored” (ocenzurowano), a date “[DATE_TIME]” and an illegible signature.\n\n4. The conditions of the applicant’s detention\n\nIn his letters to the Court of [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the applicant complained about the conditions of his detention in Wrocław Remand Centre.\n\nHe alleged in particular that he was detained with six other persons in a room measuring 16m2; he could only take walks in a closed area measuring 20m2 for 25 persons; there was no warm water available and the ventilation and sanitation were insufficient.\n\nThe applicant complained to the detention centre’s authorities about those conditions, however to no avail. He also claimed that if he were to complain to higher authorities he would run a risk of harassment by the guards, given that his correspondence had been censored.\n\nB. Relevant domestic law and practice\n\n1. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n\nThe relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre‑trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. [LOCATION], no. 31330/02, §§ 27‑33, [DATE_TIME], and [PERSON] v. [LOCATION], no. 17584/04, §§ 22‑23, [DATE_TIME].\n\n2. General rules concerning conditions of detention\n\nThe relevant law and practice pertaining to conditions of detention and to civil law action for compensation against the State Treasury are laid out in the judgment in the case of [PERSON] v. [LOCATION], no. 17885/04, §§ 64-75.\n\n3. Detainees’ correspondence and contact with family\n\nThe legal provisions concerning monitoring of detainees’ correspondence applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs 65-66 of the judgment delivered by the Court on [DATE_TIME] in [LOCATION] v. [LOCATION], no. 13425/02. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning detainees’ right to receive visitors in remand centres are stated in the Court’s judgment in the case of [PERSON] v. [LOCATION], no. 39631/06, §§ 21-25, [DATE_TIME].\n\n4. Remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings\n\nThe relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of [PERSON] v. [LOCATION], no. 15212/03 ([DATE_TIME]), §§ [DATE_TIME], ECHR 2005-V; Ratajczyk v. [LOCATION], no. 11215/02 ([LOCATION]), ECHR 2005-VIII; and the judgment in the case of [PERSON] v. [LOCATION], no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41012/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Andrzej Makowski (“the applicant”), on 10 October 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr X. Oster, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 May 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Mysłowice.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn 4 October 2002 the applicant was arrested in Blanes, Spain, under an international search and arrest warrant on suspicion of having committed several offences of fraud, forgery, perjury, uttering threats, robbery and kidnapping, while acting in an organised criminal group. On 12 February 2002 the Central Investigating Court in Madrid no. 3 (Juzgado Central de Instrucción) granted a request for the applicant’s extradition. On 28 April 2003 the applicant was brought to Poland.\n\nOn 30 April 2003 the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody until 30 June 2003. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court stressed that this had happened before and had given rise to the issue of the international search and arrest warrant and to the extradition proceedings.\n\nOn 23 September 2003 the Katowice District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 October 2003. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question, the severity of the anticipated sentence, the fear that he might tamper with evidence and the complexity of the case. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 29 October 2003 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nThe applicant maintains that when he was detained between 28 April 2003 and 1 April 2004 he was forced to testify, subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and that the conditions of his detention were poor. Moreover, he maintains that he was deprived of contact with his family.\n\nOn 20 December 2004 the applicant was indicted before the Katowice District Court. The bill of indictment listed several charges of fraud, forgery, perjury, robbery and kidnapping brought against thirteen accused, committed in the context of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 28 December 2004 the Katowice District Court further extended the applicant’s detention until 30 June 2005. The court considered that the reasons for keeping him in detention were still valid. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 9 March 2005 the Katowice Regional Court partly amended the decision of the district court and reduced the further period of his detention, fixing the deadline for 27 April 2005.\n\nOn 20 April 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) extended the applicant’s detention until 27 August 2005.\n\nAt the first hearing, held on 23 May 2005, the Katowice District Court found that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the case and referred it to the Katowice Regional Court.\n\nOn 2 June 2005 the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice (Ministerstwo Sprawiedliwosci) about delays in the proceedings and his extradition from Spain. His complaint was referred to the Katowice District Court. In a letter of 30 June 2005 the President of the Katowice District Court informed the applicant that the trial court had dealt promptly with the case, which was very complex.\n\nOn 27 June 2005 the applicant made an application for release. He requested that his detention be replaced by another preventive measure.\n\nOn 8 July 2005 the Katowice District Court dismissed the application. The court found that the evidence obtained in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against him. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. The court stressed that the fact that the applicant had acted in an organised criminal group posed in itself a risk of his obstructing the proper course of the proceedings.\n\nOn 24 August 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 March 2006. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nOn 12 December 2005 the Katowice Regional Court found that the District Court was competent to deal with the applicant’s case and referred it back to the Katowice District Court.\n\nOn 16 January 2006 the Katowice District Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release or as an alternative the replacement of detention by more lenient preventive measures. On 27 February 2006 the Katowice Regional Court upheld that decision. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nThe hearings scheduled for 21 April, 5 May and 19 May 2006 were adjourned.\n\nOn 29 March 2006 the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 30 August 2006. On 23 August 2006 that court ordered his continued detention until 30 December 2006. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 27 September 2006 by the Katowice Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 2 June 2006 the court held the first hearing on the merits.\n\nOn 1 December 2006 the Katowice District Court released the applicant under police supervision. It also ordered that the applicant be forbidden to leave his place of residence. The proceedings are still pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 13 January 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn 22 February 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed his complaint. The court examined only the proceedings before the Regional Court, namely from 17 August 2005 to 12 December 2005, and held that there were no delays for which the Regional Court could be held responsible. It noted that the court, when deciding on administrative and procedural matters, acted without delay. It further considered irrelevant the fact that at the material time the trial had not yet commenced.\n\nAs regards the proceedings before the Katowice District Court, which began on 20 December 2004 and which are still pending before it, the Court of Appeal referred this part of the complaint to the Katowice Regional Court for consideration. On 17 May 2006 the Katowice Regional Court discontinued the proceedings, since the applicant had withdrawn his complaint on 5 May 2006 about the length of the proceedings before the District Court.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41012/05) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention on remand\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], under an international search and arrest warrant on suspicion of having committed several offences of fraud, forgery, perjury, uttering threats, robbery and kidnapping, while acting in an organised criminal group. On [DATE_TIME] the Central Investigating Court in [LOCATION] no. 3 (Juzgado Central de Instrucción) granted a request for the applicant’s extradition. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant was brought to [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court ([PERSON]) remanded him in custody until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. It further referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant and to the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court stressed that this had happened before and had given rise to the issue of the international search and arrest warrant and to the extradition proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question, the severity of the anticipated sentence, the fear that he might tamper with evidence and the complexity of the case. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nThe applicant maintains that when he was detained [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] he was forced to testify, subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and that the conditions of his detention were poor. Moreover, he maintains that he was deprived of contact with his family.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was indicted before the Katowice District Court. The bill of indictment listed several charges of fraud, forgery, perjury, robbery and kidnapping brought against thirteen accused, committed in the context of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court further extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. The court considered that the reasons for keeping him in detention were still valid. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court partly amended the decision of the district court and reduced the further period of his detention, fixing the deadline for [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME].\n\nAt the first hearing, held on [DATE_TIME], the Katowice District Court found that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the case and referred it to the Katowice Regional Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice (Ministerstwo Sprawiedliwosci) about delays in the proceedings and his extradition from [LOCATION]. His complaint was referred to the Katowice District Court. In a letter of [DATE_TIME] the President of the Katowice District Court informed the applicant that the trial court had dealt promptly with the case, which was very complex.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant made an application for release. He requested that his detention be replaced by another preventive measure.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court dismissed the application. The court found that the evidence obtained in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against him. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. The court stressed that the fact that the applicant had acted in an organised criminal group posed in itself a risk of his obstructing the proper course of the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court found that the District Court was competent to deal with the applicant’s case and referred it back to the Katowice District Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release or as an alternative the replacement of detention by more lenient preventive measures. On [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court upheld that decision. The court repeated the grounds given in the previous decisions.\n\nThe hearings scheduled for [DATE_TIME] 19 [DATE_TIME] were adjourned.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] that court ordered his continued detention until [DATE_TIME]. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed on [DATE_TIME] by the Katowice Court of Appeal.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court held the first hearing on the merits.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice District Court released the applicant under police supervision. It also ordered that the applicant be forbidden to leave his place of residence. The proceedings are still pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ([PERSON] skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu [PERSON] nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal dismissed his complaint. The court examined only the proceedings before the Regional Court, namely from [DATE_TIME] to [DATE_TIME], and held that there were no delays for which the Regional Court could be held responsible. It noted that the court, when deciding on administrative and procedural matters, acted without delay. It further considered irrelevant the fact that at the material time the trial had not yet commenced.\n\nAs regards the proceedings before the Katowice District Court, which began on [DATE_TIME] and which are still pending before it, the Court of Appeal referred this part of the complaint to the Katowice Regional Court for consideration. On [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court discontinued the proceedings, since the applicant had withdrawn his complaint on [DATE_TIME] about the length of the proceedings before the District Court.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 62279/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hamdi Atiman (“the applicant”), on 17 November 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Kiran, a lawyer practising in Van. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 27 September 2011 the complaint concerning Article 2 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nFollowing the communication of the application, the Government, but not the applicant, filed further written observations (Rule 54 § 2). However, the applicant indicated his wish to pursue his application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Van.\n\nAccording to the incident and the crime scene investigation reports, upon receipt of intelligence that terrorists were hiding in the area, on 24 June 2008 a large group of gendarme officers from the Hakkari Mountain Commando Brigade blocked the road near the village of Armutdüzü in the Yüksekova district. At about 1.30 a.m. the gendarme officers stopped a lorry on suspicion of fuel smuggling. Subsequently, another lorry approached the gendarme officers. The applicant was travelling in this vehicle and it was being driven by his cousin, N.A. The soldiers ordered them to stop, but N.A. continued to drive. According to the report drafted by the gendarme officers, the driver attempted to escape and the gendarme officers fired a warning shot in the air and then fired at the tyres of the lorry to stop it. According to the applicant, they were driving down a steep hill at high speed, and as the brakes had failed, they could not stop. They maintained that they had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working and N.A. had tried to avoid hitting the other lorry, which was parked in the middle of the street, by trying to pass it on the right. He then headed towards the hills, where there was a group of gendarme officers. The gendarme officers opened fire, first in the air and then at the vehicle. The applicant was wounded in the hip and his cousin in the leg during the incident as a result of ricochet bullets.\n\nThe crime scene investigation report revealed that there were no bullet holes on the left side or the back of the lorry. Three of the tyres were flat, namely the two front tyres and the rear right tyre. Eight bullet holes were observed on the right wing over the tyres, three bullet holes in the petrol tank, a bullet entry and exit hole on the front right door, and another bullet hole on the right wheel rim. The gendarme officers further collected a total of nine bullet cases from the scene of the incident.\n\nOn the same day, a major from the District Gendarmerie wrote to the Yüksekova Public Prosecutor and requested authorisation to search the two vehicles which had been stopped by the gendarmes. Upon receipt of authorisation, the gendarme officers searched the two lorries. They found sixty‑six barrels of smuggled fuel in the first lorry and forty-five barrels in the applicant’s cousin’s lorry. No other illegal items were found in the vehicles. The applicant’s cousin, N.A., declined to sign the search report.\n\nAlso on the same day, two gendarme officers tested the lorry belonging to the applicant’s cousin in the presence of the village mayor. They reported that the vehicle had three flat tyres, that there were four bullet holes in the petrol tank, that the engine was working correctly and that the brake system was intact.\n\nSubsequently, on the same day, the applicant’s cousin gave a statement to the Yüksekova Public Prosecutor and stated that the applicant had been taken to Van Hospital. He requested that criminal proceedings be initiated against the gendarme officers who had used force against them. He emphasised that when he had been told to stop he had been driving down a steep hill at high speed, and when he could not stop, he had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working. He had had no intention of escaping from the gendarmes. He further denied that he had been transporting smuggled fuel and maintained that the barrels found by the gendarmes must have been from the other vehicle.\n\nThe public prosecutor also took statements from two eyewitnesses to the incident. These two individuals had also been in the lorry which had been stopped by the gendarmes on suspicion of fuel smuggling. According to their statements, while they were being questioned by the gendarme officers about the barrels found in their lorry, they saw another vehicle approaching. The gendarmes ordered the driver to stop but the driver failed to obey, shouting from the window that the brakes had failed. The driver then tried to pass their vehicle, which was blocking the road, on the right. The gendarmes opened fire, first into the air and then at the tyres. Both witnesses stated that the driver had no intention of escaping and was shouting that he was unable to stop.\n\nOn 15 December 2008, the applicant’s cousin, N.A., gave a statement to the Hakkari Public Prosecutor. He explained that on the day of the incident, while he was driving down a steep hill, the gendarme officers ordered him to stop. He called out that he would stop, but the gendarmes opened fire and he was shot in the leg. He was able to stop the vehicle by using the handbrake. He stated that he had had no intention or reason to escape.\n\nOn 20 February 2009 a statement was taken from the applicant at Iskele police station. He explained that on the day of the incident he had been travelling in his cousin’s lorry. His cousin had told him that there was a problem with the brake system of the vehicle. When they approached the checkpoint, a gendarme officer ordered them to stop, and they shouted out that there was a problem with the brakes and that they were not able to stop. The gendarme thought that they were trying to escape and fired a shot in the air and then started shooting at them. The applicant was shot in the hip. He concluded that the gendarme who had shot at them was not at fault, as he must have thought that they were trying to escape.\n\nOn 22 July 2008 statements were taken from the accused gendarme officers by a sergeant from the Yeniköprü Gendarme Command. They all stated that they had ordered the driver of the lorry to stop on suspicion of fuel smuggling. The driver initially stopped the vehicle. When the officers asked about the load of the lorry, he started driving away in an attempt to escape. The officers explained that they first fired warning shots in the air and then shot at the tyres to stop the lorry. They considered that the force they had used had been proportionate as they had only used their guns, whereas they were also equipped with heavy machine guns and hand grenades.\n\nBased on the evidence in the file, on 26 April 2009 the Yüsekova Public Prosecutor delivered a decision not to prosecute. He concluded that the use of force had been legal pursuant to Article 11 of Law no. 2803 on the establishment, duties and jurisdiction of the gendarmerie and section 39 (i) of the Regulation on the Duties and Powers of the Gendarmerie. He found it established that the driver of the vehicle in which the applicant was travelling had disobeyed the order to stop and had continued driving. He further pointed out that the lorry had not stopped and that the officers had first fired warning shots in the air and had then shot at the tyres of the lorry.\n\nOn 4 June 2009 the Van Assize Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding the decision of the Yüksekova Public Prosecutor to be in line with domestic law.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 62279/09) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [PERSON]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the complaint concerning Article 2 of the Convention was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nFollowing the communication of the application, the Government, but not the applicant, filed further written observations (Rule 54 § 2). However, the applicant indicated his wish to pursue his application.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nAccording to the incident and the crime scene investigation reports, upon receipt of intelligence that terrorists were hiding in the area, on [DATE_TIME] a large group of gendarme officers from the Hakkari Mountain Commando Brigade blocked the road near the village of [LOCATION] in the [LOCATION] district. At [DATE_TIME] the gendarme officers stopped a lorry on suspicion of fuel smuggling. Subsequently, another lorry approached the gendarme officers. The applicant was travelling in this vehicle and it was being driven by his cousin, N.A. The soldiers ordered them to stop, but N.A. continued to drive. According to the report drafted by the gendarme officers, the driver attempted to escape and the gendarme officers fired a warning shot in the air and then fired at the tyres of the lorry to stop it. According to the applicant, they were driving down a steep hill at high speed, and as the brakes had failed, they could not stop. They maintained that they had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working and N.A. had tried to avoid hitting the other lorry, which was parked in the middle of the street, by trying to pass it on the right. He then headed towards the hills, where there was a group of gendarme officers. The gendarme officers opened fire, first in the air and then at the vehicle. The applicant was wounded in the hip and his cousin in the leg during the incident as a result of ricochet bullets.\n\nThe crime scene investigation report revealed that there were no bullet holes on the left side or the back of the lorry. Three of the tyres were flat, namely the two front tyres and the rear right tyre. Eight bullet holes were observed on the right wing over the tyres, three bullet holes in the petrol tank, a bullet entry and exit hole on the front right door, and another bullet hole on the right wheel rim. The gendarme officers further collected a total of nine bullet cases from the scene of the incident.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], a major from the District Gendarmerie wrote to the Yüksekova Public Prosecutor and requested authorisation to search the two vehicles which had been stopped by the gendarmes. Upon receipt of authorisation, the gendarme officers searched the two lorries. They found sixty‑six barrels of smuggled fuel in the first lorry and forty-five barrels in the applicant’s cousin’s lorry. No other illegal items were found in the vehicles. The applicant’s cousin, N.A., declined to sign the search report.\n\nAlso on [DATE_TIME], two gendarme officers tested the lorry belonging to the applicant’s cousin in the presence of the village mayor. They reported that the vehicle had three flat tyres, that there were four bullet holes in the petrol tank, that the engine was working correctly and that the brake system was intact.\n\nSubsequently, on [DATE_TIME], the applicant’s cousin gave a statement to the Yüksekova Public Prosecutor and stated that the applicant had been taken to Van Hospital. He requested that criminal proceedings be initiated against the gendarme officers who had used force against them. He emphasised that when he had been told to stop he had been driving down a steep hill at high speed, and when he could not stop, he had shouted from the window that the brakes were not working. He had had no intention of escaping from the gendarmes. He further denied that he had been transporting smuggled fuel and maintained that the barrels found by the gendarmes must have been from the other vehicle.\n\nThe public prosecutor also took statements from two eyewitnesses to the incident. These two individuals had also been in the lorry which had been stopped by the gendarmes on suspicion of fuel smuggling. According to their statements, while they were being questioned by the gendarme officers about the barrels found in their lorry, they saw another vehicle approaching. The gendarmes ordered the driver to stop but the driver failed to obey, shouting from the window that the brakes had failed. The driver then tried to pass their vehicle, which was blocking the road, on the right. The gendarmes opened fire, first into the air and then at the tyres. Both witnesses stated that the driver had no intention of escaping and was shouting that he was unable to stop.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the applicant’s cousin, N.A., gave a statement to the Hakkari Public Prosecutor. He explained that on [DATE_TIME] of the incident, while he was driving down a steep hill, the gendarme officers ordered him to stop. He called out that he would stop, but the gendarmes opened fire and he was shot in the leg. He was able to stop the vehicle by using the handbrake. He stated that he had had no intention or reason to escape.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] a statement was taken from the applicant at Iskele police station. He explained that on [DATE_TIME] of the incident he had been travelling in his cousin’s lorry. His cousin had told him that there was a problem with the brake system of the vehicle. When they approached the checkpoint, a gendarme officer ordered them to stop, and they shouted out that there was a problem with the brakes and that they were not able to stop. The gendarme thought that they were trying to escape and fired a shot in the air and then started shooting at them. The applicant was shot in the hip. He concluded that the gendarme who had shot at them was not at fault, as he must have thought that they were trying to escape.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] statements were taken from the accused gendarme officers by a sergeant from the Yeniköprü Gendarme Command. They all stated that they had ordered the driver of the lorry to stop on suspicion of fuel smuggling. The driver initially stopped the vehicle. When the officers asked about the load of the lorry, he started driving away in an attempt to escape. The officers explained that they first fired warning shots in the air and then shot at the tyres to stop the lorry. They considered that the force they had used had been proportionate as they had only used their guns, whereas they were also equipped with heavy machine guns and hand grenades.\n\nBased on the evidence in the file, on [DATE_TIME] the Yüsekova Public Prosecutor delivered a decision not to prosecute. He concluded that the use of force had been legal pursuant to Article 11 of Law no. 2803 on the establishment, duties and jurisdiction of the gendarmerie and section 39 (i) of the Regulation on the Duties and Powers of the Gendarmerie. He found it established that the driver of the vehicle in which the applicant was travelling had disobeyed the order to stop and had continued driving. He further pointed out that the lorry had not stopped and that the officers had first fired warning shots in the air and had then shot at the tyres of the lorry.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Van Assize Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding the decision of the Yüksekova Public Prosecutor to be in line with domestic law.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38227/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Marcin Harazin (“the applicant”), on 2 October 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr W. Hermeliński, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 4 May 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Tychy.\n\nOn 13 July 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary.\n\nOn 15 July 2000 the Tychy District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of three months in view of the strong suspicion that he had committed five counts of burglary. It considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence, given the fact that he had only partly confessed. Further, the court referred to the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings by going into hiding. In that regard, the court relied on evidence from one of the applicant’s co-suspects, who had stated that, shortly before having been arrested, the applicant had tried to leave for Germany in order to evade serving a sentence of imprisonment which had been previously imposed on him. Finally, the court had regard to the severity of the anticipated penalty.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant was charged with 8 counts of burglary. He confessed to 2 counts.\n\nOn 30 January 2001 the District Prosecutor terminated the investigation. On the same day he filed a bill of indictment with the Tychy District Court. The applicant had been indicted on 8 charges of burglary and one charge of assault. There were 6 other defendants in the case. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 42 witnesses.\n\nFrom 1 June 2001 to 19 December 2002 the trial court listed 10 hearings (for 1 June, 6 July, 9 November and 7 December 2001 and 30 January, 20 March, 17 May, 17 July, 27 September and 19 December 2002). All those hearings were cancelled for various reasons, usually because the police had failed to bring the accused from prison.\n\nThe trial began on 17 January 2003. The subsequent hearings were held on 30 January, 21 February and 20 and 21 March 2003. At the hearing held on the latter date the District Court fined 5 witnesses who had failed to appear.\n\nThe District Court several times prolonged the applicant’s detention, holding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and that, given his attempt to leave Poland and the resultant risk that he might go into hiding or tamper with evidence, as well as the fact that he had only partly confessed, keeping him in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the anticipated penalty. Lastly, the court had regard to the fact that the applicant had a previous conviction.\n\nThe relevant decisions were given on 12 October 2000 (prolonging his detention until 5 January 2001), on 28 December 2000 (ordering his continued detention until 13 February 2001), on 8 February 2001 (extending his detention until 13 May 2001), on 10 May 2001 (prolonging that period until 13 August 2001), on 10 August 2001 (ordering his continued detention until 13 November 2001), on 5 November 2001 (extending his detention until 13 February 2002), on 13 February 2002 (prolonging his detention until 13 May 2002) and on 13 May 2002 (ordering his continued detention until 7 July 2002).\n\nIn its decision of 10 April 2002 dismissing the applicant’s appeal against the prolongation of his detention, the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) instructed the District Court to take determined measures with a view to speedily terminating the trial.\n\nOn 14 June 2002 the District Court made an application to the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) pursuant to Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond the statutory time-limit of 2 years. The court stressed that, due to the complex nature of the case, it had so far been impossible for it to open the trial and that the applicant should be kept in custody since the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid.\n\nOn 26 June 2002 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention until 30 December 2002. It relied on the same grounds as previously invoked by the District Court. It noted that the applicant had attempted to flee the country. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal considered that the trial court had not been responsible for the delays incurred in the proceedings to date. In this respect, it referred, inter alia, to the fact that 7 hearings had been cancelled since the police had failed to bring the accused from prison. On the other hand, it considered that prolongation of the applicant’s detention until 30 December 2002 would give the District Court sufficient time to conclude the proceedings, provided that it accelerated its examination of the case.\n\nOn 14 November 2002 the Tychy District Court made yet another application under Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, asking the Court of Appeal to prolong the applicant’s detention until 30 June 2003. It stressed that it had still been impossible for it to begin the trial and that the grounds previously given for keeping the applicant in custody were still valid.\n\nOn 27 November 2002 the Court of Appeal partly granted the application and ordered that the applicant be held in custody until 31 March 2003. It drew the District Court’s attention to the fact that it had not stated any concrete reasons to justify the fact that the proceedings had not been terminated within the time-limit of 2 years specified in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the laconic statement of the District Court that the trial had not been concluded for reasons which could not be attributed to it, was not sufficient. The Court of Appeal also criticised the fact that between June 2002 and 30 December 2002 the District Court had listed only two hearings. A hearing scheduled for 17 July 2002 was cancelled because not all of the victims had been properly summoned, while the hearing listed for 27 September 2002 was cancelled due to the holiday of one of the counsel. The Court of Appeal further noted that on 6 November 2002 a new judge had been assigned to the case. However, it noted that the District Court had not taken any significant measures aimed at concluding the proceedings, as had been indicated in the earlier decisions of the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal. It lastly stressed that the case was not particularly complex and suggested that the District Court should properly organise the trial and terminate it by the end of March 2003.\n\nThe applicant was released on 21 March 2003. All the applicant’s earlier applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention had been to no avail.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38227/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON], of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court ([PERSON]) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for [DATE_TIME] in view of the strong suspicion that he had committed five counts of burglary. It considered that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence, given the fact that he had only partly confessed. Further, the court referred to the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings by going into hiding. In that regard, the court relied on evidence from one of the applicant’s co-suspects, who had stated that, shortly before having been arrested, the applicant had tried to leave for [LOCATION] in order to evade serving a sentence of imprisonment which had been previously imposed on him. Finally, the court had regard to the severity of the anticipated penalty.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant was charged with 8 counts of burglary. He confessed to 2 counts.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Prosecutor terminated the investigation. On [DATE_TIME] he filed a bill of indictment with the Tychy District Court. The applicant had been indicted on 8 charges of burglary and one charge of assault. There were 6 other defendants in the case. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 42 witnesses.\n\nFrom [DATE_TIME] to [DATE_TIME] the trial court listed 10 hearings (for [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]). All those hearings were cancelled for various reasons, usually because the police had failed to bring the accused from prison.\n\nThe trial began on [DATE_TIME]. The subsequent hearings were held on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. At the hearing held on the latter date the District Court fined 5 witnesses who had failed to appear.\n\nThe District Court several times prolonged the applicant’s detention, holding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and that, given his attempt to leave [LOCATION] and the resultant risk that he might go into hiding or tamper with evidence, as well as the fact that he had only partly confessed, keeping him in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court also relied on the serious nature of the charges against the applicant and the severity of the anticipated penalty. Lastly, the court had regard to the fact that the applicant had a previous conviction.\n\nThe relevant decisions were given on [DATE_TIME] (prolonging his detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (ordering his continued detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (extending his detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (prolonging that period until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (ordering his continued detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (extending his detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (prolonging his detention until [DATE_TIME]) and on [DATE_TIME] (ordering his continued detention until [DATE_TIME]).\n\nIn its decision of [DATE_TIME] dismissing the applicant’s appeal against the prolongation of his detention, the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) instructed the District Court to take determined measures with a view to speedily terminating the trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court made an application to the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]) pursuant to Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ([PERSON] postępowania karnego), asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond the statutory time-limit of [DATE_TIME]. The court stressed that, due to the complex nature of the case, it had so far been impossible for it to open the trial and that the applicant should be kept in custody since the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the same grounds as previously invoked by the District Court. It noted that the applicant had attempted to flee the country. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal considered that the trial court had not been responsible for the delays incurred in the proceedings to date. In this respect, it referred, inter alia, to the fact that 7 hearings had been cancelled since the police had failed to bring the accused from prison. On the other hand, it considered that prolongation of the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME] would give the District Court sufficient time to conclude the proceedings, provided that it accelerated its examination of the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court made yet another application under Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, asking the Court of Appeal to prolong the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]. It stressed that it had still been impossible for it to begin the trial and that the grounds previously given for keeping the applicant in custody were still valid.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Appeal partly granted the application and ordered that the applicant be held in custody until [DATE_TIME]. It drew the District Court’s attention to the fact that it had not stated any concrete reasons to justify the fact that the proceedings had not been terminated within the time-limit of [DATE_TIME] specified in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the laconic statement of the District Court that the trial had not been concluded for reasons which could not be attributed to it, was not sufficient. The Court of Appeal also criticised the fact that [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the District Court had listed only two hearings. A hearing scheduled for [DATE_TIME] was cancelled because not all of the victims had been properly summoned, while the hearing listed for [DATE_TIME] was cancelled due to the holiday of one of the counsel. The Court of Appeal further noted that on [DATE_TIME] a new judge had been assigned to the case. However, it noted that the District Court had not taken any significant measures aimed at concluding the proceedings, as had been indicated in the earlier decisions of the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal. It lastly stressed that the case was not particularly complex and suggested that the District Court should properly organise the trial and terminate it by [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was released on [DATE_TIME]. All the applicant’s earlier applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention had been to no avail.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 20482/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Lesław Cibicki (“the applicant”), on 13 June 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms J. Okonek, a lawyer practising in Wrocław. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been deprived of his right of access to a court, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn 10 October 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The President also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Wrocław.\n\nIn 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in which he asked for the division of his late parents’ marital property. The applicant’s mother died in the 1960s and he was her heir. The applicant’s father died in 1992 and his second wife inherited after him according to his last will. The applicant claimed that his parents’ marital property included a collection of 300 valuable paintings worth approximately 460,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). The applicant’s father’s second wife contested the fact that the paintings belonged to the estate in question and submitted that they were her own assets.\n\nOn 23 December 1997 the applicant was exempted from court fees.\n\nIn 2001 the other party to the proceedings, the second wife of the applicant’s late father, died and her daughter joined the proceedings as her heir.\n\nOn 17 July 2003 the Wrocław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided of its own motion to order the preparation of an expert opinion regarding the value and origin of the paintings allegedly acquired during the applicant’s parents’ marriage. The court found that the applicant described many of the paintings, some of which had been in the possession of the other party and whose existence and ownership had been contested, as belonging to his parents. The assessment of his submissions required special knowledge concerning the authors of the paintings, their description and authenticity. It had thus been impossible to assess those issues without the assistance of an expert. The court considered that since the applicant had initiated the proceedings he should bear the costs of the opinion and ordered him to pay PLN 5,000 (approximately 1,200 euros (EUR)) as an advance on the costs of the expert opinion.\n\nOn 21 August 2003 the applicant applied for an exemption from court fees. He submitted that he was a pensioner and was receiving an old‑age pension of PLN 550. His unemployed wife and her mentally handicapped brother, the latter receiving PLN 400 in invalidity benefit, were both in his sole charge. The applicant explained that although he had been represented by a lawyer of his choice, the latter had not received any payment but had agreed to accept a certain percentage of the award received at the end of the proceedings.\n\nOn 12 January 2004 the Wrocław District Court dismissed his application. The court acknowledged the applicant’s difficult financial situation. However, it considered that since the beginning of the proceedings in 1997 he should have saved money for the purpose of paying the future court fees. The court calculated that by putting aside between ten and twenty percent of his income the applicant could have saved up PLN 5,000 since 1997.\n\nThe applicant’s lawyer appealed against this decision, explaining at length the difficult financial situation of the applicant’s family. He submitted that 75% of the family’s monthly income went on rent for their flat, monthly charges and the costs of medicines for the applicant and his wife’s brother. The remaining sum of money did not allow for any savings; in fact, it was not sufficient for the applicant to support himself and his family; they had been surviving with the financial help of their friends and relatives.\n\nOn 15 April 2004 the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the appeal. The court underlined the fact that the applicant had already benefited from an exemption from the court fees for lodging his civil claim, thus it had not been justified to expect the State Treasury to cover further costs for the applicant.\n\nOn 18 November 2004 the Wrocław District Court gave a decision in the applicant’s case in which it divided the property in question. The court found that the estate in question consisted only of a wardrobe and a grandfather clock. The applicant was awarded the latter and ordered to pay the other party PLN 2,225 and to reimburse them PLN 14,400 for the costs of the proceedings. With regard to the issue of the expert opinion concerning the paintings that had been described by the applicant as having been acquired during his father’s first marriage, the court found: “The consequence [of the applicant’s failure to pay the court fees for the expert opinion] was to omit this evidence as the court had established that this evidence was not necessary to reach a decision in the instant case – it was not the only piece of evidence on which it could base its finding. Producing this evidence was in the applicant’s own interest, as he had borne the burden of providing evidence of the elements of the estate that belonged to his parents and was his mother’s inheritance. The assessment of other evidence collected in the case leads to unequivocal conclusion that the marital property in question did not include any of the known and existing paintings of the disputed collection.”\n\nThe applicant’s lawyer appealed against the decision in particular as regards the court’s assessment that the paintings had not belonged to his parents’ estate.\n\nThe court ordered the applicant to pay court fees for his appeal in the amount of PLN 4,649. The applicant appealed against this decision and applied to be exempted from court fees.\n\nOn 22 April 2005 the Wrocław District Court, composed of the same judge who had given the decision on the merits in the applicant’s case, dismissed his application. The court found that the applicant’s financial standing had not changed since 2004 when his application for exemption from the court fees for the expert opinion had been dismissed. Moreover, he had not incurred any expenses afterwards as he had failed to pay for the expert opinion. Thus, in the court’s opinion the applicant should have saved enough money to pay the future costs of the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant’s lawyer appealed against the decision.\n\nOn 7 July 2005 the Wrocław District Court partly allowed the appeal and exempted the applicant from fees exceeding PLN 600 (approximately EUR 150). The court considered that a total refusal to exempt the applicant from court fees for pursuing his appeal would deprive him of the possibility to pursue his claim before the second-instance court. It found however that the applicant would be able to pay the sum of PLN 600 without harming his own well-being or that of his family. It based its finding on the fact that the applicant’s monthly income was PLN 700 and the family’s income had also included his wife’s brother’s monthly benefit of PLN 450.\n\nSince the applicant failed to pay the court fees for proceeding with his appeal, on 19 September 2005 the Wrocław District Court rejected the appeal.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 20482/03) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in Wrocław. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been deprived of his right of access to a court, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3). The President also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in Wrocław.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the applicant instituted civil proceedings in which he asked for the division of his late parents’ marital property. The applicant’s mother died in [DATE_TIME] and he was her heir. The applicant’s father died in [DATE_TIME] and his second wife inherited after him according to his last will. The applicant claimed that his parents’ marital property included a collection of 300 valuable paintings worth approximately 460,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). The applicant’s father’s second wife contested the fact that the paintings belonged to the estate in question and submitted that they were her own assets.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was exempted from court fees.\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the other party to the proceedings, the second wife of the applicant’s late father, died and her daughter joined the proceedings as her heir.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court ([PERSON]) decided of its own motion to order the preparation of an expert opinion regarding the value and origin of the paintings allegedly acquired during the applicant’s parents’ marriage. The court found that the applicant described many of the paintings, some of which had been in the possession of the other party and whose existence and ownership had been contested, as belonging to his parents. The assessment of his submissions required special knowledge concerning the authors of the paintings, their description and authenticity. It had thus been impossible to assess those issues without the assistance of an expert. The court considered that since the applicant had initiated the proceedings he should bear the costs of the opinion and ordered him to pay PLN 5,000 (approximately 1,200 euros (EUR)) as an advance on the costs of the expert opinion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant applied for an exemption from court fees. He submitted that he was a pensioner and was receiving an old‑age pension of PLN 550. His unemployed wife and her mentally handicapped brother, the latter receiving PLN 400 in invalidity benefit, were both in his sole charge. The applicant explained that although he had been represented by a lawyer of his choice, the latter had not received any payment but had agreed to accept a certain percentage of the award received at the end of the proceedings.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court dismissed his application. The court acknowledged the applicant’s difficult financial situation. However, it considered that since the beginning of the proceedings in [DATE_TIME] he should have saved money for the purpose of paying the future court fees. The court calculated that by putting aside between ten and twenty percent of his income the applicant could have saved up PLN 5,000 since [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant’s lawyer appealed against this decision, explaining at length the difficult financial situation of the applicant’s family. He submitted that 75% of the family’s [DATE_TIME] income went on rent for their flat, [DATE_TIME] charges and the costs of medicines for the applicant and his wife’s brother. The remaining sum of money did not allow for any savings; in fact, it was not sufficient for the applicant to support himself and his family; they had been surviving with the financial help of their friends and relatives.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the appeal. The court underlined the fact that the applicant had already benefited from an exemption from the court fees for lodging his civil claim, thus it had not been justified to expect the State Treasury to cover further costs for the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court gave a decision in the applicant’s case in which it divided the property in question. The court found that the estate in question consisted only of a wardrobe and a grandfather clock. The applicant was awarded the latter and ordered to pay the other party PLN 2,225 and to reimburse them PLN 14,400 for the costs of the proceedings. With regard to the issue of the expert opinion concerning the paintings that had been described by the applicant as having been acquired during his father’s first marriage, the court found: “The consequence [of the applicant’s failure to pay the court fees for the expert opinion] was to omit this evidence as the court had established that this evidence was not necessary to reach a decision in the instant case – it was not the only piece of evidence on which it could base its finding. Producing this evidence was in the applicant’s own interest, as he had borne the burden of providing evidence of the elements of the estate that belonged to his parents and was his mother’s inheritance. The assessment of other evidence collected in the case leads to unequivocal conclusion that the marital property in question did not include any of the known and existing paintings of the disputed collection.”\n\nThe applicant’s lawyer appealed against the decision in particular as regards the court’s assessment that the paintings had not belonged to his parents’ estate.\n\nThe court ordered the applicant to pay court fees for his appeal in the amount of PLN 4,649. The applicant appealed against this decision and applied to be exempted from court fees.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court, composed of the same judge who had given the decision on the merits in the applicant’s case, dismissed his application. The court found that the applicant’s financial standing had not changed since [DATE_TIME] when his application for exemption from the court fees for the expert opinion had been dismissed. Moreover, he had not incurred any expenses afterwards as he had failed to pay for the expert opinion. Thus, in the court’s opinion the applicant should have saved enough money to pay the future costs of the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant’s lawyer appealed against the decision.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court partly allowed the appeal and exempted the applicant from fees exceeding PLN 600 (approximately EUR 150). The court considered that a total refusal to exempt the applicant from court fees for pursuing his appeal would deprive him of the possibility to pursue his claim before the second-instance court. It found however that the applicant would be able to pay the sum of PLN 600 without harming his own well-being or that of his family. It based its finding on the fact that the applicant’s [DATE_TIME] income was PLN 700 and the family’s income had also included his wife’s brother’s [DATE_TIME] benefit of PLN 450.\n\nSince the applicant failed to pay the court fees for proceeding with his appeal, on [DATE_TIME] the Wrocław District Court rejected the appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 34720/97) against the Republic of Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Irish nationals, Mr Anthony Heaney and Mr William McGuinness (“the applicants”), on 17 January 1997.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr D. Robinson, a lawyer practising in Dublin. The Irish Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, Ms E. Kilcullen, Mr R. Siev and Mr A. Connolly, all of the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicants alleged that section 52 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 constituted a violation of the rights guaranteed by Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 July 1998 the Commission decided to communicate to the Government the applicants' complaints under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention. The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\n5. The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court\n\n(Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr J. Hedigan, the judge elected in respect of Ireland, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Ms N. Vajić, the judge elected in respect of Croatia, to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1). 6. By a decision of 21 September 1999, the Court declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry.]. 7. The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Court decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine) and the parties replied in writing to each other's observations on the merits.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nAt approximately 4.10 a.m. on 23 October 1990 a large explosion occurred at a British Army/Royal Ulster Constabulary checkpoint in County Derry. Five British soldiers and one civilian were killed and a number of other British army personnel were seriously injured.\n\nApproximately an hour and a half later, Irish police officers on surveillance duty noted a light in a house approximately four miles from the scene of the explosion. At approximately 6.05 a.m. on 24 October 1990 a warrant was obtained to search the house. At or around 7 a.m. that morning the police entered the house and found an assortment of gloves (rubber and knitted), balaclavas, caps and other clothing. The seven men in the house, including the owner and the applicants, were arrested and detained by the police under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 (“the 1939 Act”). As later noted by the High Court (see paragraph 15 below), it was suspected that the bombing had been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (an unlawful paramilitary organisation known as the IRA) and the applicants were, in turn, suspected by the police of membership of that organisation and of involvement in the bombing.\n\nBoth applicants were cautioned by police officers in the usual terms, namely that they were not required to say anything unless they wished to do so and they were also informed that anything they did say would be taken down in writing and might be given in evidence against them. Mr Heaney was then questioned about the bombing and about his presence in the house where he was arrested. He refused to answer the questions put to him. Police officers then read section 52 of the 1939 Act to him and he was requested pursuant to that section to give a full account of his movements and actions between 6 p.m. on 23 October and 6.55 a.m. on 24 October 1990. He refused to answer any questions. Mr McGuinness was also questioned about the explosion and about his presence in the house where he was arrested. He refused to answer those questions. He was then requested to account for his movements between 1 a.m. and 7.15 a.m. on 24 October 1990. He refused to answer. Police officers then read section 52 of the 1939 Act to him and he was handed a copy of the section and asked to read it. He continued not to answer questions put to him.\n\nOn 25 October 1990 both applicants were brought to the Special Criminal Court in Dublin and charged with the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation (contrary to section 21 of the 1939 Act) and of failing to account for their movements (contrary to section 52 of the 1939 Act).\n\nOn 19 April 1991 the applicants' trial in the Special Criminal Court took place. On 26 June 1991 the applicants were acquitted of the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation but each was convicted of failing to provide an account of their movements during a specified period contrary to section 52 of the 1939 Act. The court rejected their arguments that section 52 must be read as including a right to refuse to provide such information on reasonable grounds and about the confusion caused by police officers giving the usual caution about the right to remain silent and then making a request for information under section 52 of the 1939 Act. Both applicants were sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Their sentences commenced on 26 June 1991. They were released on 10 November 1991.\n\nThe applicants then appealed against their conviction and sentence under section 52 to the Court of Criminal Appeal. As regards their conviction, they submitted that the Special Criminal Court had erred in finding that the applicants were not confused as a result of the caution about their right to remain silent and the conflicting request for information under section 52 by the same officers. They argued that section 52 should have been read as including the possibility of a refusal to give information based on reasonable excuse. As to their sentence, they argued that the confusion caused by the caution and request for information should have been a mitigating factor; that there was no evidence that they warranted the maximum sentence; and that the court failed to take into account the time the applicants had spent in custody prior to their trial.\n\nOn 3 May 1992 the applicants took proceedings in the High Court challenging the constitutionality of section 52 of the 1939 Act. The proceedings pending before the Court of Criminal Appeal were consequently adjourned.\n\nBy a judgment dated 24 June 1994, the High Court rejected their application. It based the applicants' right not to answer questions as regards their movements on Article 38 of the Constitution rather than on Article 40, noting that their case related to suspects in custody and not to accused persons on trial. However, it was considered that section 52 constituted a proportionate interference with the applicants' right to silence, the objective being to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the State. In addition, the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational. The High Court also considered that the restriction did not excessively impair the right to silence given the objective pursued by section 52 and the other legal protections applicable to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act, which protections were afforded to minimise the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and to safeguard against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act. Those protections were listed by the High Court: the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest; the obligation to inform the suspect of the offences under the 1939 Act and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested; the right to medical assistance; the right of access to a court; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross-examining a person in detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act.\n\nBy a judgment dated 23 July 1996 the Supreme Court rejected the applicants' appeal, finding that section 52 of the 1939 Act was not inconsistent with the Constitution. It was noted that section 52 of the 1939 Act was silent on the use which could be made of statements provided pursuant to requests made under section 52. While the Court of Criminal Appeal had suggested in a previous case (The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGowan [1979] Irish Reports 45) that information lawfully obtained under section 52 might be later used in evidence, the Supreme Court expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not. The Supreme Court considered that the right to silence was a corollary to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution and that the relevant assessment was to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to Article 40 of the Constitution. It noted that the 1939 Act was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and that the proclamation made pursuant to section 35 of the 1939 Act remained in force. As to whether section 52 restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the State was attempting to protect the public, the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish, nevertheless, to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights. However, it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the State to protect itself. The entitlement of those with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order. The Supreme Court concluded that the restriction in section 52 was proportionate to the State's entitlement to protect itself.\n\nThe applicants' appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to their conviction under section 52 of the 1939 Act has been adjourned generally pending the outcome of the present application.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 34720/97) against [LOCATION] lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two [NRP] nationals, Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON] (“the applicants”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Irish Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, [PERSON], Mr [PERSON] and [PERSON], all of the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicants alleged that section 52 of the Offences against the State Act [DATE_TIME] constituted a violation of the rights guaranteed by Articles 6, [DATE_TIME] and 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Commission decided to communicate to the Government the applicants' complaints under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention. The application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\n5. The application was allocated to [LOCATION] of the Court\n\n(Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr [PERSON], the judge elected in respect of [LOCATION], withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed [PERSON], the judge elected in respect of [LOCATION], to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1). 6. By a decision of [DATE_TIME], the Court declared the application admissible [Note by the Registry. The Court's decision is obtainable from the Registry.]. 7. The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Court decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine) and the parties replied in writing to each other's observations on the merits.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nAt [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME] a large explosion occurred at a British Army/Royal Ulster Constabulary checkpoint in [LOCATION]. Five [NRP] soldiers and one civilian were killed and a number of other [NRP] army personnel were seriously injured.\n\n[DATE_TIME], [NRP] police officers on surveillance duty noted a light in a house approximately four miles from the scene of the explosion. At [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME] a warrant was obtained to search the house. At or [DATE_TIME] the police entered the house and found an assortment of gloves (rubber and knitted), balaclavas, caps and other clothing. The seven men in the house, including the owner and the applicants, were arrested and detained by the police under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act [DATE_TIME] (“the 1939 Act”). As later noted by the High Court (see paragraph 15 below), it was suspected that the bombing had been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (an unlawful paramilitary organisation known as the IRA) and the applicants were, in turn, suspected by the police of membership of that organisation and of involvement in the bombing.\n\nBoth applicants were cautioned by police officers in the usual terms, namely that they were not required to say anything unless they wished to do so and they were also informed that anything they did say would be taken down in writing and might be given in evidence against them. Mr [PERSON] was then questioned about the bombing and about his presence in the house where he was arrested. He refused to answer the questions put to him. Police officers then read section 52 of the 1939 Act to him and he was requested pursuant to that section to give a full account of his movements and actions [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME]. He refused to answer any questions. Mr [PERSON] was also questioned about the explosion and about his presence in the house where he was arrested. He refused to answer those questions. He was then requested to account for his movements [DATE_TIME] on [DATE_TIME]. He refused to answer. Police officers then read section 52 of the 1939 Act to him and he was handed a copy of the section and asked to read it. He continued not to answer questions put to him.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] both applicants were brought to the Special Criminal Court in [LOCATION] and charged with the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation (contrary to section 21 of the 1939 Act) and of failing to account for their movements (contrary to section 52 of the 1939 Act).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicants' trial in the Special Criminal Court took place. On [DATE_TIME] the applicants were acquitted of the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation but each was convicted of failing to provide an account of their movements during a specified period contrary to section 52 of the 1939 Act. The court rejected their arguments that section 52 must be read as including a right to refuse to provide such information on reasonable grounds and about the confusion caused by police officers giving the usual caution about the right to remain silent and then making a request for information under section 52 of the 1939 Act. Both applicants were sentenced to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. Their sentences commenced on [DATE_TIME]. They were released on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicants then appealed against their conviction and sentence under section 52 to the Court of Criminal Appeal. As regards their conviction, they submitted that the Special Criminal Court had erred in finding that the applicants were not confused as a result of the caution about their right to remain silent and the conflicting request for information under section 52 by the same officers. They argued that section 52 should have been read as including the possibility of a refusal to give information based on reasonable excuse. As to their sentence, they argued that the confusion caused by the caution and request for information should have been a mitigating factor; that there was no evidence that they warranted the maximum sentence; and that the court failed to take into account the time the applicants had spent in custody prior to their trial.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicants took proceedings in the High Court challenging the constitutionality of section 52 of the 1939 Act. The proceedings pending before the Court of Criminal Appeal were consequently adjourned.\n\nBy a judgment dated [DATE_TIME], the High Court rejected their application. It based the applicants' right not to answer questions as regards their movements on Article 38 of the Constitution rather than on Article 40, noting that their case related to suspects in custody and not to accused persons on trial. However, it was considered that section 52 constituted a proportionate interference with the applicants' right to silence, the objective being to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the State. In addition, the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational. The High Court also considered that the restriction did not excessively impair the right to silence given the objective pursued by section 52 and the other legal protections applicable to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act, which protections were afforded to minimise the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and to safeguard against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act. Those protections were listed by the High Court: the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest; the obligation to inform the suspect of the offences under the 1939 Act and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested; the right to medical assistance; the right of access to a court; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross-examining a person in detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act.\n\nBy a judgment dated [DATE_TIME] the Supreme Court rejected the applicants' appeal, finding that section 52 of the 1939 Act was not inconsistent with the Constitution. It was noted that section 52 of the 1939 Act was silent on the use which could be made of statements provided pursuant to requests made under section 52. While the Court of Criminal Appeal had suggested in a previous case (The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. [PERSON] [[DATE_TIME]] Irish Reports 45) that information lawfully obtained under section 52 might be later used in evidence, the Supreme Court expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not. The Supreme Court considered that the right to silence was a corollary to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution and that the relevant assessment was to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to Article 40 of the Constitution. It noted that the 1939 Act was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and that the proclamation made pursuant to section 35 of the 1939 Act remained in force. As to whether section 52 restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the State was attempting to protect the public, the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish, nevertheless, to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights. However, it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the State to protect itself. The entitlement of those with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order. The Supreme Court concluded that the restriction in section 52 was proportionate to the State's entitlement to protect itself.\n\nThe applicants' appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to their conviction under section 52 of the 1939 Act has been adjourned generally pending the outcome of the present application.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 8363/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Sebastian Kliza (“the applicant”), on 20 February 2004.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affaires.\n\nOn 7 April 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr Sebastian Kliza, is a Polish national who was born in 1978 and lives in Mikołów, Poland.\n\nA. The applicant's pre-trial detention\n\nThe applicant was arrested on 26 January 2001 on suspicion of having committed a series of armed robberies as a member of an organised criminal group. On 28 January 2001 the Tychy District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that he be detained pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nOn 9 April 2001 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged his detention until 17 July 2001. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It also stressed that his detention was justified by the need to obtain further evidence.\n\nOn 9 July 2001 the Katowice Regional Court prolonged his detention until 17 October 2001. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. The court further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation justified holding him in custody. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It also relied on the risk that he might tamper with evidence.\n\nOn 8 October 2001 the Katowice Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention until 17 January 2002. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nOn an unspecified date in January 2002, the applicant was indicted before the Tychy District Court. The bill of indictment comprised 44 charges of armed robbery committed by an organised criminal group. The charges in the bill of indictment concerned 4 co-accused.\n\nDuring the proceedings the applicant's detention was extended on several occasions. On 15 January 2002 the Tychy District Court prolonged his detention until 17 July 2002. On 8 July 2002 the court ordered that the term should be prolonged until 17 October 2002. On 16 October 2002 it ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until 17 January 2003. It referred to the grounds for detention listed in the previous decisions.\n\nOn 2 January 2003 the Tychy District Court prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 January 2003. It repeated the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions and added that the case was complex, given the number of accused and victims. It further observed that the trial had not yet begun for reasons beyond the trial court's control.\n\nOn 22 January 2003 the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny), on an application from the trial court, prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 June 2003. It repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant's detention. It also found that there were no special grounds, as specified in Article 259 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe measure.\n\nOn 25 June 2003, on an application from the Tychy District Court, the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant's detention until 26 October 2003. The court relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. The court also considered that, given the severity of the likely sentence and the fact that the applicant had been charged with acting in an organised criminal group, there was a risk that he would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. It also acknowledged the delay in the proceedings and asked the trial court to expedite the examination of the case.\n\nOn 22 October 2003 the Katowice Court of Appeal, on an application from the Tychy District Court, prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 January 2004. It also stated that the proceedings were inordinately lengthy.\n\nSubsequently, on 7 January 2004 the Katowice Court of Appeal, on an application from the trial court, prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 March 2004. On 17 March 2004 the Katowice Court of Appeal, on an application from the trial court, prolonged the applicant's detention until 26 May 2004. It stated that the delays in the proceedings were to a large extent caused by the failure to escort the accused to the court and the lack of discipline on the part of the parties to the proceedings.\n\nIn the meantime, the District Court had proceeded with the trial. Hearings listed for 10 May and 3 July 2002 were postponed. A hearing scheduled for 20 August 2002 was adjourned upon the request of one of the lawyers.\n\nOf 17 hearings held between 30 January 2003 and 19 December 2003 10 were adjourned.\n\nFrom 23 January to 2 April 2004 the court held 7 hearings. One of them was adjourned on account of the absence of one of the lawyers.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings the applicant made numerous, unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against refusals to release him and decisions extending his detention.\n\nOn 9 April 2004 the Tychy District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 8 years' imprisonment. He appealed.\n\nThe applicant's detention was subsequently prolonged on several occasions.\n\nOn 11 February 2005 the Katowice Regional Court amended the trial court's judgment, acquitted the applicant of the charge of acting in an organised criminal group and reduced the applicant's sentence to 6 years' imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nIn the meantime, between 13 September 2001 and 10 November 2002 and, subsequently, between 11 June 2003 and 11 November 2003 the applicant served prison sentences which had been imposed on him in other criminal proceedings.\n\nB. Monitoring of the applicant's correspondence\n\nOn 1 March 2004 the Court received the applicant's first letter of 8 February 2004. The letter was sent while the applicant was detained in the Zabrze Detention Centre. The envelope bears the following stamps: “Zabrze Detention Centre received on 16.02.2004” (Areszt Śledczy w Zabrzu Wpłynęło dnia 16.02.2004) and “District Court in Tychy, censored” (Sąd Rejonowy w Tychach, cenzurowano), a hand-written sentence: “Z: without censorship” (Z: bez cenzury), a hand-written date: “18.2.4”, and an illegible signature.\n\nOn 27 April 2004 the Court received the applicant's application form. The envelope in which the application form was delivered bears the following stamps: “Zabrze Detention Centre received on 8.04.2004” (Areszt Śledczy w Zabrzu Wpłynęło dnia 8.04.2004) and “District Court in Tychy, censored” (Sąd Rejonowy w Tychach, cenzurowano), and an illegible signature.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 8363/04) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry of Foreign Affaires.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr [PERSON], is a [NRP] national who was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nA. The applicant's pre-trial detention\n\nThe applicant was arrested on [DATE_TIME] on suspicion of having committed a series of armed robberies as a member of an organised criminal group. On [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court ([PERSON]) ordered that he be detained pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged his detention until [DATE_TIME]. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It also stressed that his detention was justified by the need to obtain further evidence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court prolonged his detention until [DATE_TIME]. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts. The court further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation justified holding him in custody. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It also relied on the risk that he might tamper with evidence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. It repeated the grounds previously given for his detention.\n\nOn an unspecified date in [DATE_TIME], the applicant was indicted before the Tychy District Court. The bill of indictment comprised 44 charges of armed robbery committed by an organised criminal group. The charges in the bill of indictment concerned 4 co-accused.\n\nDuring the proceedings the applicant's detention was extended on several occasions. On [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court prolonged his detention until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the court ordered that the term should be prolonged until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] it ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until [DATE_TIME]. It referred to the grounds for detention listed in the previous decisions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. It repeated the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions and added that the case was complex, given the number of accused and victims. It further observed that the trial had not yet begun for reasons beyond the trial court's control.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]), on an application from the trial court, prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. It repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant's detention. It also found that there were no special grounds, as specified in Article 259 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe measure.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], on an application from the Tychy District Court, the Katowice Court of Appeal extended the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. The court relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question. The court also considered that, given the severity of the likely sentence and the fact that the applicant had been charged with acting in an organised criminal group, there was a risk that he would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. It also acknowledged the delay in the proceedings and asked the trial court to expedite the examination of the case.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal, on an application from the Tychy District Court, prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. It also stated that the proceedings were inordinately lengthy.\n\nSubsequently, on [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal, on an application from the trial court, prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal, on an application from the trial court, prolonged the applicant's detention until [DATE_TIME]. It stated that the delays in the proceedings were to a large extent caused by the failure to escort the accused to the court and the lack of discipline on the part of the parties to the proceedings.\n\nIn the meantime, the District Court had proceeded with the trial. Hearings listed for [DATE_TIME] were postponed. A hearing scheduled for [DATE_TIME] was adjourned upon the request of one of the lawyers.\n\nOf 17 hearings held [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] were adjourned.\n\nFrom [DATE_TIME] the court held 7 hearings. One of them was adjourned on account of the absence of one of the lawyers.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings the applicant made numerous, unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against refusals to release him and decisions extending his detention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Tychy District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. He appealed.\n\nThe applicant's detention was subsequently prolonged on several occasions.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court amended the trial court's judgment, acquitted the applicant of the charge of acting in an organised criminal group and reduced the applicant's sentence to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy).\n\nIn the meantime, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and, subsequently, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the applicant served prison sentences which had been imposed on him in other criminal proceedings.\n\nB. Monitoring of the applicant's correspondence\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court received the applicant's first letter of [DATE_TIME]. The letter was sent while the applicant was detained in the Zabrze Detention Centre. The envelope bears the following stamps: “Zabrze Detention Centre received on [DATE_TIME]” ([PERSON] w [PERSON] dnia [DATE_TIME]) and “District Court in [LOCATION], censored” ([PERSON], cenzurowano), a hand-written sentence: “Z: without censorship” (Z: [PERSON]), a hand-written date: “18.2.4”, and an illegible signature.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court received the applicant's application form. The envelope in which the application form was delivered bears the following stamps: “Zabrze Detention Centre received on [DATE_TIME]” ([PERSON] w [PERSON]) and “District Court in [LOCATION], censored” ([PERSON], cenzurowano), and an illegible signature.",

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Istanbul. The second applicant is a joint-stock company incorporated in Turkey in 1991 and dissolved in 2001 (see below). The first applicant was appointed as Director General of Mesopotamia Publishing on 24 December 2001.\n\nA. Background to the case\n\nAs regards the Şanlıurfa branch office 4. On 26 October 1997 Mesopotamia Publishing inaugurated a branch office in Şanlıurfa. On the same day, police officers from the Şanlıurfa Security Directorate conducted a search of that office, confiscating certain newspapers, magazines, books, cassettes and documents, which were allegedly illegal. 5. On 27 October 1997 the Deputy Governor of Şanlıurfa requested the Ministry of Industry and Trade to institute proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing with a view to its dissolution. 6. On 30 October 1997 the public prosecutor instituted proceedings against Mr Murat Gökdağ, the manager of the Şanlıurfa branch office, and Ms Nuray Şen, the then Director General of Mesopotamia Publishing. They were accused of storing banned books at the branch office. 7. On 6 June 2000 the Şanlıurfa Magistrate’s Court held that the criminal proceedings should be discontinued since the prosecution was time-barred under Article 102 of the Criminal Code. As regards the Diyarbakır Branch Office 8. On 13, 14, 20, 25, 27 and 28 December 1997, the Diyarbakır office of Mesopotamia Publishing was searched by police officers. Various books and publications, including a calendar published by Mesopotamia Publishing, were confiscated. 9. On 14 January 1997 the Diyarbakır office was closed on the order of the Diyarbakır Governor. 10. On 10 February 1998 the Diyarbakır Governor requested the Ministry of Industry and Trade to institute proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing with a view to its dissolution under the relevant provisions of the Commercial Code. 11. On an unspecified date criminal proceedings were instituted in the Istanbul State Security Court against members of Mesopotamia Publishing’s board of directors for publishing a calendar which was allegedly used to disseminate propaganda in favour of the illegal Kurdistan Workers’ Party (“the PKK”). 12. On 17 September 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court suspended the proceedings, pursuant to Law No. 4454 on the suspension of pending cases and penalties in media-related offences. As regards the Izmir branch office 13. On 26 December 1997 the Izmir office of Mesopotamia Publishing was searched by police officers. Certain publications, which were allegedly illegal, and a satellite decoder were seized. 14. On 30 December 1997 the Izmir Governor asked the Ministry of Industry and Trade to institute dissolution proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing, alleging that the company had been disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK. 15. On an unspecified date, criminal proceedings were instituted in the Izmir Magistrate’s Court against Ms Hatice Çoban, the manager of the Izmir branch. 16. On 14 May 1998 the court acquitted Ms Çoban of the charges against her.\n\nB. Dissolution proceedings against the applicant company\n\nFollowing complaints lodged by the Şanlıurfa Governor and the Diyarbakır Governor respectively, on 24 February 1998 the Ministry of Industry and Trade (“the plaintiff”) instituted proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing in the Istanbul Beyoğlu Commercial Court, with a view to its dissolution on account of its activities against public order. On 27 February 1998 the Istanbul Beyoğlu Commercial Court registered the case against Mesopotamia Publishing. It decided, inter alia, to notify the parties of the date of the hearing fixed for 3 April 1998, in accordance with Articles 509 and 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provided a warning that if one of the parties failed to appear before it or to submit observations, the court would not be precluded from determining the merits of the case. It further decided to notify Mesopotamia Publishing of the plaintiff’s written submissions and evidence.\n\nOn 12 March 1998 the above documents were served on Mesopotamia Publishing, as recorded in the Trade Commercial Registry. They were picked up by a certain Mr M.B., who signed the notification record as an authorised representative (şirket yetkilisi).\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiff submitted a number of pieces of evidence to the case file in support of its claim, including official documents, such as incident and seizure reports relating to the above‑mentioned searches. They were admitted to the case file on 17 March 1998.\n\nAt a hearing on 3 April 1998 the court noted the absence of Mesopotamia Publishing, but observed that the notification had been duly served. The evidence provided by the plaintiff was read out. The court decided to compile further information and documents regarding the accusations against Mesopotamia Publishing from the Şanlıurfa, Izmir and Diyarbakır public prosecutors’ offices.\n\nThe court held regular hearings. At the hearing held on 28 July 1999 the court decided to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the cases before the criminal courts.\n\nOn 19 October 2001 the court decided to dissolve Mesopotamia Publishing, pursuant to Article 274 § 2 of the Commercial Code. In its decision, it noted that, despite due notification, the company had failed to attend the hearings and had not submitted any observations. It took into account the incidents which had taken place at the Şanlıurfa and Diyarbakır branch offices, and held that the company was responsible for them. It considered that the activities of those branches had breached public order and that therefore the company had to be dissolved. A liquidator was assigned. The decision of the court was served on Mesopotamia Publishing, as recorded in the Trade Commercial Registry.\n\nOn 28 March 2002 Mesopotamia Publishing appealed against the decision of the first-instance court. In its procedural grounds of appeal, it contended, inter alia, that the court had failed to duly notify it of the case because the notification had been served on a certain Mr M.B., who was not a member of the board of directors at that time. In addition, Mesopotamia Publishing argued that it had not been notified of the evidence admitted in the course of the proceedings. In its substantive grounds of appeal, it claimed that the court had decided on the basis of two incidents in connection with which the company had not been convicted.\n\nAt a hearing on 15 October 2002 the Court of Cassation, having heard the parties, decided to adjourn the deliberations.\n\nOn 17 October 2002 the Court of Cassation, having examined the case file, the parties’ submissions to it and the documents contained therein, dismissed Mesopotamia Publishing’s objections.\n\nOn 10 December 2002 Mesopotamia Publishing requested the Court of Cassation to rectify its judgment. It repeated its earlier submissions regarding what it described as “substantial grounds for appeal”.\n\nOn 24 January 2003 the Court of Cassation dismissed the above‑mentioned rectification request.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 21377/03) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] and by a [NRP] company, [PERSON] (hereinafter referred to as “Mesopotamia Publishing”) on [DATE_TIME]. The applicants were represented by [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION]. The second applicant is a joint-stock company incorporated in [LOCATION] in [DATE_TIME] and dissolved in [DATE_TIME] (see below). The first applicant was appointed as Director General of Mesopotamia Publishing on [DATE_TIME].\n\nA. Background to the case\n\nAs regards the Şanlıurfa branch office 4. On [DATE_TIME] Mesopotamia Publishing inaugurated a branch office in Şanlıurfa. On [DATE_TIME], police officers from the Şanlıurfa Security Directorate conducted a search of that office, confiscating certain newspapers, magazines, books, cassettes and documents, which were allegedly illegal. 5. On [DATE_TIME] the Deputy Governor of Şanlıurfa requested the Ministry of Industry and Trade to institute proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing with a view to its dissolution. 6. On [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor instituted proceedings against Mr [PERSON], the manager of the Şanlıurfa branch office, and Ms Nuray Şen, the then Director General of Mesopotamia Publishing. They were accused of storing banned books at the branch office. 7. On [DATE_TIME] the Şanlıurfa Magistrate’s Court held that the criminal proceedings should be discontinued since the prosecution was time-barred under Article 102 of the Criminal Code. As regards the Diyarbakır Branch Office 8. On 13, [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], the [LOCATION] office of Mesopotamia Publishing was searched by police officers. Various books and publications, including a calendar published by Mesopotamia Publishing, were confiscated. 9. On [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] office was closed on the order of the [LOCATION] Governor. 10. On [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] Governor requested the Ministry of Industry and Trade to institute proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing with a view to its dissolution under the relevant provisions of the Commercial Code. 11. On an unspecified date criminal proceedings were instituted in the Istanbul State Security Court against members of Mesopotamia Publishing’s board of directors for publishing a calendar which was allegedly used to disseminate propaganda in favour of the illegal Kurdistan Workers’ Party (“the PKK”). 12. On [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul State Security Court suspended the proceedings, pursuant to Law No. 4454 on the suspension of pending cases and penalties in media-related offences. As regards the [LOCATION] branch office 13. On [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] office of Mesopotamia Publishing was searched by police officers. Certain publications, which were allegedly illegal, and a satellite decoder were seized. 14. On [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] Governor asked the Ministry of Industry and Trade to institute dissolution proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing, alleging that the company had been disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK. 15. On an unspecified date, criminal proceedings were instituted in the Izmir Magistrate’s Court against [PERSON], the manager of the [LOCATION] branch. 16. On [DATE_TIME] the court acquitted [PERSON] of the charges against her.\n\nB. Dissolution proceedings against the applicant company\n\nFollowing complaints lodged by the Şanlıurfa Governor and the [LOCATION] Governor respectively, on [DATE_TIME] the Ministry of Industry and Trade (“the plaintiff”) instituted proceedings against Mesopotamia Publishing in the Istanbul Beyoğlu Commercial Court, with a view to its dissolution on account of its activities against public order. On [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul Beyoğlu Commercial Court registered the case against Mesopotamia Publishing. It decided, inter alia, to notify the parties of the date of the hearing fixed for [DATE_TIME], in accordance with Articles 509 and 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provided a warning that if one of the parties failed to appear before it or to submit observations, the court would not be precluded from determining the merits of the case. It further decided to notify Mesopotamia Publishing of the plaintiff’s written submissions and evidence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the above documents were served on Mesopotamia Publishing, as recorded in the Trade Commercial Registry. They were picked up by a certain Mr [PERSON], who signed the notification record as an authorised representative ([PERSON]).\n\nIn the meantime, the plaintiff submitted a number of pieces of evidence to the case file in support of its claim, including official documents, such as incident and seizure reports relating to the above‑mentioned searches. They were admitted to the case file on [DATE_TIME].\n\nAt a hearing on [DATE_TIME] the court noted the absence of Mesopotamia Publishing, but observed that the notification had been duly served. The evidence provided by the plaintiff was read out. The court decided to compile further information and documents regarding the accusations against Mesopotamia Publishing from the Şanlıurfa, [LOCATION] and [LOCATION] public prosecutors’ offices.\n\nThe court held regular hearings. At the hearing held on [DATE_TIME] the court decided to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the cases before the criminal courts.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court decided to dissolve Mesopotamia Publishing, pursuant to Article 274 § 2 of the Commercial Code. In its decision, it noted that, despite due notification, the company had failed to attend the hearings and had not submitted any observations. It took into account the incidents which had taken place at the Şanlıurfa and [LOCATION] branch offices, and held that the company was responsible for them. It considered that the activities of those branches had breached public order and that therefore the company had to be dissolved. A liquidator was assigned. The decision of the court was served on Mesopotamia Publishing, as recorded in the Trade Commercial Registry.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Mesopotamia Publishing appealed against the decision of the first-instance court. In its procedural grounds of appeal, it contended, inter alia, that the court had failed to duly notify it of the case because the notification had been served on a certain Mr [PERSON], who was not a member of the board of directors at that time. In addition, Mesopotamia Publishing argued that it had not been notified of the evidence admitted in the course of the proceedings. In its substantive grounds of appeal, it claimed that the court had decided on the basis of two incidents in connection with which the company had not been convicted.\n\nAt a hearing on [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation, having heard the parties, decided to adjourn the deliberations.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation, having examined the case file, the parties’ submissions to it and the documents contained therein, dismissed Mesopotamia Publishing’s objections.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] Mesopotamia Publishing requested the Court of Cassation to rectify its judgment. It repeated its earlier submissions regarding what it described as “substantial grounds for appeal”.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation dismissed the above‑mentioned rectification request.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 56827/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Koray Düzgören (“the applicant”), on 15 October 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms A. J. Stock, Mr M. Muller, Mr T. Otty and Ms J. Gordon of the Kurdish Human Rights Project in London. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 28 September 2004 the Court (Second Section) declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged lack of independence and impartiality of the military court, the alleged interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression and the alleged lack of an effective remedy to the Government. Under Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1947 and lives in London.\n\nOn 1 April 1998 the applicant, who is a journalist, distributed a leaflet concerning the conscientious objector Mr O.M.U, outside the Ankara State Security Court. He also handed the leaflet to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court together with a petition stating that he should be prosecuted for having committed a crime.\n\nThe leaflet, entitled “Freedom to think - an initiative against the crime of thought” contained the press release issued by O. M. U on 1 September 1995. The latter had been previously convicted and sentenced on account of this press release. The relevant parts of the leaflet are as follows: Preface and Epilogue: “... For the purpose of defending the free expression of every kind of thought, we who have signed as publishers, convey this 'convicted' text to the people, regardless of its contents and the question whether or not we share its contents, even though some of us do not agree with some lines in it...' The press release of O. M. U: “Good morning, Today's press conference is not organised by the Izmir Association of the Opponents of War. The responsibility for this conference rests exclusively with me. As you know, the case, which was brought before the Ankara Military Court of the Office of the Chief of Staff where I was allegedly accused of committing the crime of 'inciting others to evade military service', was concluded on 29 August. ... The army, unable to deal with us through judicial methods, think that they can draw the opponents of war away from the public view. First of all, I am not a deserter; I am a 'conscientious objector'. I neither intend to do military service nor desert. There is no reason to desert, because I defend the principle that people should exercise their right not to do military service without having to go into hiding. As to the papers given by the Recruitment Office...I am going to burn them right now before your eyes... I am not a soldier and I never will be. Of course, I am aware that I will be summoned for military service, but until I am summoned, whenever that may be there will be no changes to my lifestyle. They can find me here and take me by force. But I will resist to the end in the barracks, and I am underlining that I will refuse to do military service in any shape or fashion.”\n\nOn 1 April 1998 the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court took the applicant's statement in which the applicant reiterated the content of his petition. He maintained that, by publishing and distributing the above-mentioned leaflet, he had committed the same offence for which O. M. U. had been convicted. He contended that he agreed with the contents of the leaflet. He further pointed out that there were judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which referred to conscientious objectors. He claimed that the leaflet was not intended to dissuade people from doing military service or to incite them to desert. He further stated that in the Netherlands conscientious objectors did not do their military service, but were given other jobs. He commented that maybe in the future the same would also be true for Turkey. He concluded that his aim was to obtain the abolition of compulsory military service in Turkey.\n\nOn 4 June 1998 the military public prosecutor at the General Staff Court in Ankara filed a bill of indictment, accusing the applicant of inciting others to evade military service. He requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under Article 155 of the Criminal Code and Article 58 of the Military Penal Code.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the General Staff Court in Ankara. During the proceedings the applicant reiterated his previous submissions. In particular, he claimed that he was a defender of freedom of expression and challenged the independence and impartiality of the court.\n\nOn 9 March 1999 the court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to two months' imprisonment and to a fine of 1,520,000 Turkish Liras (TL) (approximately 3.5 Euros (EUR) at the time of the events). In its reasoning, the court held that it had competence to deal with the case pursuant to the Constitution and domestic law and that there was no ruling of the European Court of Human Rights which had concluded that military courts were extraordinary courts. As regards the merits, the court considered that, by distributing the leaflet containing the press release which led to O. M. U's conviction and by handing the leaflet to the public prosecutor and asking the latter to take legal action, the applicant's actions were deliberate and that he had committed the offence knowingly and willingly. The court, relying on Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, Article 10 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 29 § 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirmed that freedom of expression and the free dissemination of ideas was not an absolute right. Citing relevant articles of the Criminal Code, it reasoned that the provisions under which the applicant was charged pursued the aim of eliminating threats to the unity of the country, national security and sovereignty. The court observed that Article 155 of the Criminal Code was in accordance with international law and that the applicant's case fell within the scope of Article 155 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 19 April 1999 the applicant appealed to the Military Court of Cassation. In his appeal, the applicant, relying on Articles 6 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, contended that he should not have been tried by a military court and that the act which he had committed could not be considered to be an offence.\n\nOn 25 May 1999 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the General Staff Court. In its decision the court, referring to domestic law and the jurisprudence of the Court, held that the military courts had jurisdiction and competence to try the applicant and, after having assessed the contents of the leaflet, concluded that the judgment given by the General Staff Court was in accordance with the law.\n\nOn 17 July 1999 the applicant left Turkey in order to avoid imprisonment.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 56827/00) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON] of the Kurdish Human Rights Project in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court (Second Section) declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged lack of independence and impartiality of the military court, the alleged interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression and the alleged lack of an effective remedy to the Government. Under Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant, who is a journalist, distributed a leaflet concerning the conscientious objector [PERSON], outside the Ankara State Security Court. He also handed the leaflet to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court together with a petition stating that he should be prosecuted for having committed a crime.\n\nThe leaflet, entitled “Freedom to think - an initiative against the crime of thought” contained the press release issued by [PERSON] on [DATE_TIME]. The latter had been previously convicted and sentenced on account of this press release. The relevant parts of the leaflet are as follows: Preface and Epilogue: “... For the purpose of defending the free expression of every kind of thought, we who have signed as publishers, convey this 'convicted' text to the people, regardless of its contents and the question whether or not we share its contents, even though some of us do not agree with some lines in it...' The press release of [PERSON]: “Good morning, [DATE_TIME]'s press conference is not organised by the Izmir Association of the Opponents of War. The responsibility for this conference rests exclusively with me. As you know, the case, which was brought before the Ankara Military Court of the Office of the Chief of Staff where I was allegedly accused of committing the crime of 'inciting others to evade military service', was concluded on [DATE_TIME]. ... The army, unable to deal with us through judicial methods, think that they can draw the opponents of war away from the public view. First of all, I am not a deserter; I am a 'conscientious objector'. I neither intend to do military service nor desert. There is no reason to desert, because I defend the principle that people should exercise their right not to do military service without having to go into hiding. As to the papers given by the Recruitment Office...I am going to burn them right now before your eyes... I am not a soldier and I never will be. Of course, I am aware that I will be summoned for military service, but until I am summoned, whenever that may be there will be no changes to my lifestyle. They can find me here and take me by force. But I will resist to the end in the barracks, and I am underlining that I will refuse to do military service in any shape or fashion.”\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court took the applicant's statement in which the applicant reiterated the content of his petition. He maintained that, by publishing and distributing the above-mentioned leaflet, he had committed the same offence for which [PERSON] had been convicted. He contended that he agreed with the contents of the leaflet. He further pointed out that there were judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which referred to conscientious objectors. He claimed that the leaflet was not intended to dissuade people from doing military service or to incite them to desert. He further stated that in the [LOCATION] conscientious objectors did not do their military service, but were given other jobs. He commented that maybe in the future the same would also be true for [LOCATION]. He concluded that his aim was to obtain the abolition of compulsory military service in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the military public prosecutor at the General Staff Court in [LOCATION] filed a bill of indictment, accusing the applicant of inciting others to evade military service. He requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced under Article 155 of the Criminal Code and Article 58 of the Military Penal Code.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the criminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the General Staff Court in [LOCATION]. During the proceedings the applicant reiterated his previous submissions. In particular, he claimed that he was a defender of freedom of expression and challenged the independence and impartiality of the court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to [DATE_TIME] imprisonment and to a fine of 1,520,000 Turkish Liras (TL) (approximately 3.5 Euros (EUR) at the time of the events). In its reasoning, the court held that it had competence to deal with the case pursuant to the Constitution and domestic law and that there was no ruling of the European Court of Human Rights which had concluded that military courts were extraordinary courts. As regards the merits, the court considered that, by distributing the leaflet containing the press release which led to [PERSON] conviction and by handing the leaflet to the public prosecutor and asking the latter to take legal action, the applicant's actions were deliberate and that he had committed the offence knowingly and willingly. The court, relying on Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, Article 10 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 29 § 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirmed that freedom of expression and the free dissemination of ideas was not an absolute right. Citing relevant articles of the Criminal Code, it reasoned that the provisions under which the applicant was charged pursued the aim of eliminating threats to the unity of the country, national security and sovereignty. The court observed that Article 155 of the Criminal Code was in accordance with international law and that the applicant's case fell within the scope of Article 155 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant appealed to the Military Court of Cassation. In his appeal, the applicant, relying on Articles 6 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, contended that he should not have been tried by a military court and that the act which he had committed could not be considered to be an offence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Military Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the General Staff Court. In its decision the court, referring to domestic law and the jurisprudence of the Court, held that the military courts had jurisdiction and competence to try the applicant and, after having assessed the contents of the leaflet, concluded that the judgment given by the General Staff Court was in accordance with the law.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant left [LOCATION] in order to avoid imprisonment.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28520/95) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Sadık Önder (“the applicant”), on 28 August 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M.S. Okçuoğlu, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he was subjected to ill-treatment in police custody in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr R. Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr M. F.Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of 29 June 1999, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is born in 1969 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nA. Treatment in police custody\n\nOn 9 July 1994 the applicant with fourteen other people was taken into police custody by the Anti-Terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of being a member of the PKK.\n\nThe applicant alleges that he was ill-treated and tortured in the police car on the way to the Istanbul Security Directorate and during his detention there. He claims that during his interrogation, he was blindfolded and stripped naked. He was strung up by his arms in the form of torture known as “Palestinian hanging”. His head was hit against the wall and he was held parallel to the ground on his hands and feet. He was also electrocuted, threatened and insulted.\n\nThe applicant further claims that he was coerced into signing a statement in which it was stated that he had worked for and had been involved in the terrorist activities of the PKK. After having signed the statement prepared by the police, he was allegedly kept in custody for one more week so that the signs of the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected would disappear. During that week, he claims that a police officer came to his cell at regular intervals and applied a medicine on his wounds in order to cover up the signs of ill-treatment. He claims that due to this medicine his scars healed very quickly.\n\nThe Government submit that the applicant was questioned by the police on 15 July 1994. They have produced a copy of a statement signed by the applicant on this occasion.\n\nOn 22 July 1994 the applicant together with 14 other detainees was examined by Dr T. Taner Apaydın at the Istanbul Forensic Medical Department. According to the medical report prepared by Dr Apaydın, the applicant showed no signs of ill-treatment.\n\nOn 23 July 1994 the applicant was brought before the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court. According to the records of this hearing, the applicant admitted that he had been involved with PKK related activities in the past and had been convicted on that account by the Erzincan State Security Court in 1989. He denied having any current relation with the PKK. He stated that the police invented the statement taken in custody.\n\nThe applicant alleges that he was brought to the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court together with the other detainees on 22 July 1994 but that the Public Prosecutor did not take his statement because he had complained to the prosecutor that he had been tortured in police custody. He further stated that because he told to the prosecutor that he was subjected to torture, he was once again tortured by the police. The Government contested this argument and stated that the applicant was brought for the first time before the Public Prosecutor on 23 July 1994.\n\nThe applicant alleges that he told the prosecutor on 23 July 1994 of his subjection to torture but that his statement was not taken into consideration by the Public Prosecutor and was not written down on the hearing records.\n\nThe applicant further stated that he was not seen by a doctor before being questioned by the Prosecutor on 23 July 1994 and consequently he does not have any medical evidence concerning the torture he was subjected to on 22 July 1994.\n\nOn 23 July 1994 the applicant was also brought before the Judge at the State Security Court. He denied the allegations against him and stated that he was not a member of the PKK. He further declared that the statement he gave to the Public Prosecutor was true. The Judge ordered his detention on remand.\n\nThe applicant claims that he told the State Security Court Judge that he had been tortured in police custody and that he had explained this to the Public Prosecutor at the State Security Court. However the case files show that the applicant did not claim to have being subjected to ill-treatment neither before the Public Prosecutor nor the State Security Court.\n\nWhile the applicant was held in detention in prison, he requested to see a doctor. The prison doctor prepared a provisional report for the applicant and he was sent to the Eyüp Forensic Medical Department for a medical examination.\n\nOn 22 August 1994 the medical report prepared by the institution and signed by the medical expert stated that the applicant complained of widespread pain on his back, right arm and on both of his legs but that he could not find any signs of traumatic lesions. The medical report further stated that the complaints were not life threatening but accorded him one day's sick leave.\n\nOn 15 June 1995 the Chamber of Medicine of Istanbul (Istanbul Tabib Odası), in the context of disciplinary proceedings following complaints, found that Dr T. Taner Apaydın had concealed signs of torture in the medical examinations conducted on several persons between 3 February and 7 October 1994 and he was, therefore, prohibited from practising as a doctor for six months.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 12 December 1994 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with the court, requesting that the court to apply Articles 168 §§ 1 and 2 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n\nC. Criminal proceedings against the policemen\n\nOn 13 September 1994 the applicant filed a complaint with the Istanbul Public Prosecutor's Office. He alleged that he had been ill-treated while in police custody and requested that proceedings be instituted against the police officers. He submitted the medical report of 22 August 1994 as proof of his ill-treatment.\n\nOn 11 January 1995 the Istanbul Public Prosecutor, referring to the medical report of the Eyüp Forensic Medical Department, gave a decision of non-prosecution on account of lack of evidence.\n\nOn 8 February 1995 the applicant filed an objection with the Beyoglu Assize Court against the Public Prosecutor's decision.\n\nOn 7 March 1995 the Beyoğlu Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28520/95) against [LOCATION] lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he was subjected to ill-treatment in police custody in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on [DATE_TIME], when Protocol No. 11 to the [LOCATION] came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to [LOCATION] of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr [PERSON], the judge elected in respect of [LOCATION], withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed [PERSON] to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\n\nBy a decision of [DATE_TIME], the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nA. Treatment in police custody\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant with fourteen other people was taken into police custody by the Anti-Terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of being a member of the PKK.\n\nThe applicant alleges that he was ill-treated and tortured in the police car on the way to the Istanbul Security Directorate and during his detention there. He claims that during his interrogation, he was blindfolded and stripped naked. He was strung up by his arms in the form of torture known as “[NRP] hanging”. His head was hit against the wall and he was held parallel to the ground on his hands and feet. He was also electrocuted, threatened and insulted.\n\nThe applicant further claims that he was coerced into signing a statement in which it was stated that he had worked for and had been involved in the terrorist activities of the PKK. After having signed the statement prepared by the police, he was allegedly kept in custody for [DATE_TIME] so that the signs of the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected would disappear. During [DATE_TIME], he claims that a police officer came to his cell at regular intervals and applied a medicine on his wounds in order to cover up the signs of ill-treatment. He claims that due to this medicine his scars healed very quickly.\n\nThe Government submit that the applicant was questioned by the police on [DATE_TIME]. They have produced a copy of a statement signed by the applicant on this occasion.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant together with 14 other detainees was examined by [PERSON] at the Istanbul Forensic Medical Department. According to the medical report prepared by [PERSON], the applicant showed no signs of ill-treatment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was brought before the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court. According to the records of this hearing, the applicant admitted that he had been involved with PKK related activities in the past and had been convicted on that account by the Erzincan State Security Court in [DATE_TIME]. He denied having any current relation with the PKK. He stated that the police invented the statement taken in custody.\n\nThe applicant alleges that he was brought to the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court together with the other detainees on [DATE_TIME] but that the Public Prosecutor did not take his statement because he had complained to the prosecutor that he had been tortured in police custody. He further stated that because he told to the prosecutor that he was subjected to torture, he was once again tortured by the police. The Government contested this argument and stated that the applicant was brought for the first time before the Public Prosecutor on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant alleges that he told the prosecutor on [DATE_TIME] of his subjection to torture but that his statement was not taken into consideration by the Public Prosecutor and was not written down on the hearing records.\n\nThe applicant further stated that he was not seen by a doctor before being questioned by the Prosecutor on [DATE_TIME] and consequently he does not have any medical evidence concerning the torture he was subjected to on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was also brought before the Judge at the State Security Court. He denied the allegations against him and stated that he was not a member of the PKK. He further declared that the statement he gave to the Public Prosecutor was true. The Judge ordered his detention on remand.\n\nThe applicant claims that he told the State Security Court Judge that he had been tortured in police custody and that he had explained this to the Public Prosecutor at the State Security Court. However the case files show that the applicant did not claim to have being subjected to ill-treatment neither before the Public Prosecutor nor the State Security Court.\n\nWhile the applicant was held in detention in prison, he requested to see a doctor. The prison doctor prepared a provisional report for the applicant and he was sent to the Eyüp Forensic Medical Department for a medical examination.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the medical report prepared by the institution and signed by the medical expert stated that the applicant complained of widespread pain on his back, right arm and on both of his legs but that he could not find any signs of traumatic lesions. The medical report further stated that the complaints were not life threatening but accorded him [DATE_TIME] sick leave.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Chamber of Medicine of Istanbul ([LOCATION] Tabib Odası), in the context of disciplinary proceedings following complaints, found that [PERSON] had concealed signs of torture in the medical examinations conducted on several persons [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] and he was, therefore, prohibited from practising as a doctor for [DATE_TIME].\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with the court, requesting that the court to apply Articles 168 §§ 1 and 2 and 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n\nC. Criminal proceedings against the policemen\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed a complaint with the Istanbul Public Prosecutor's Office. He alleged that he had been ill-treated while in police custody and requested that proceedings be instituted against the police officers. He submitted the medical report of [DATE_TIME] as proof of his ill-treatment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Istanbul Public Prosecutor, referring to the medical report of the Eyüp Forensic Medical Department, gave a decision of non-prosecution on account of lack of evidence.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed an objection with the Beyoglu Assize Court against the Public Prosecutor's decision.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Beyoğlu Assize Court dismissed the applicant's objections.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31330/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Antoni Gołek (“the applicant”), on 3 August 2002.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr W. Hermeliński, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 4 May 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Bielsko-Biała, Poland.\n\nOn 15 March 2000 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On 16 March 2000 the Żywiec District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that he be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the serious nature of that offence, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, in particular the process of obtaining evidence.\n\nDuring the investigation the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions. He filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against the decisions prolonging his detention. The applicant made repeated applications for release on personal grounds, submitting that he had to secure the care and well‑being of his 3 year old son. He also contested the reasonableness of the charge against him, maintaining that it was solely based on evidence from his common-law wife who was his alleged accomplice.\n\nOn 7 June 2000 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged his detention until 15 September 2000. On 8 September 2000 it ordered that he be kept in custody until 15 December 2000. On 6 December 2000 it extended that period until 15 March 2001. The court reiterated the grounds originally given for the applicant’s detention. It also considered that the need to take further evidence from experts justified the continuation of that measure.\n\nOn 1 March 2001 the applicant, together with his common-law wife, was indicted on charges of homicide, attempted homicide, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, uttering threats, theft, burglary, fraud and illegally possessing explosives and dangerous substances before the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court. In all, 24 charges were brought against the applicant. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 95 witnesses.\n\nThe Regional Court continually prolonged the applicant’s detention pending trial. On 7 March 2001 it extended his detention until 30 June 2001.\n\nOn 7 June 2001 the trial court dismissed the applicant’s request of 5 June 2001 to sever his case and assign it to a separate set of proceedings. It adjourned the hearing due to the absence of the co-defendant’s counsel.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s detention was prolonged on 25 June and 26 November 2001. The court held that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid. It stressed the strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question.\n\nIn the meantime, on 6 July 2001, the applicant had unsuccessfully challenged the composition of the court.\n\nOn 18 July 2001 he requested the trial court to appoint him a new legal aid counsel.\n\nOn 1 and 23 August 2001 respectively he requested the trial court to assign his case to a separate set of proceedings. Subsequently, at the hearing held on 6 September 2001 the applicant withdrew his motion.\n\nThe hearings scheduled for 19 September and 8 October 2001 had to be adjourned due to the co-defendant’s absence. Two other hearings were adjourned due to the absence of the judge rapporteur.\n\nThe trial court held further hearings: on 6 November 2001, 5 and 22 February 2002. In the meantime, the hearings listed for 15 November and 12 December 2001 were cancelled due to the illness of the judge.\n\nSubsequently, as the length of the applicant’s detention reached the statutory time-limit of 2 years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the Regional Court made 4 applications to the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny), asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond that term. The Court of Appeal granted those applications on 13 March 2002 (extending the applicant’s detention until 5 October 2002), on 2 October 2002 (extending his detention until 5 March 2003), on 26 February 2003 (prolonging that term until 31 May 2003) and on 21 May 2003 (ordering his continued detention until 31 August 2003). In all those decisions the Court of Appeal considered that the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention were still valid.\n\nThe applicant’s numerous applications for release and his appeals against the detention decisions were to no avail.\n\nBetween March and September 2002, the trial court listed 10 hearings. The applicant and his lawyer were present at all the hearings. During this period the applicant on several occasions refused to participate in the trial, on two occasions he challenged the composition of the court. He also requested the court to appoint him a new legal aid counsel and applied for his case to be assigned to a separate set of proceedings. All his motions were dismissed. In the meantime, the hearing scheduled for 17 May 2002 had been cancelled. The hearings listed for 12 and 13 June 2002 had likewise been cancelled due to the illness of the judge.\n\nFurther hearings were held on 2, 15 and 30 October, 14 and 28 November 2002. On 12 December 2002 the applicant refused to participate in the hearing due to his illness. The trial court proceeded with taking evidence and ordered that an expert opinion on the applicant’s health be obtained.\n\nSubsequently, hearings were held on the following dates: 16 January, 12 and 27 February 2003. On 12 February 2003 the trial court acknowledged the delay in the proceedings and stated that it was caused by the particular complexity of the case and other obstacles which could not have been removed by the relevant authorities.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 13 March 2003 had to be adjourned due to the applicant’s absence. Further hearings were held on: 8 and 17 April, 6, 7 and 28 May, 3 and 10 June 2003. The applicant and his counsel were present at the hearings. As of April 2003 the court had heard evidence from 85 witnesses.\n\nOn 12 June 2003 the Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn 24 June 2004 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment.\n\nOn 12 October 2004 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31330/02) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON], of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the applicant’s pre-trial detention to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION], [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed homicide. On [DATE_TIME] the Żywiec District Court ([PERSON]) ordered that he be detained on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question, the serious nature of that offence, the severity of the anticipated penalty and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation, in particular the process of obtaining evidence.\n\nDuring the investigation the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions. He filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against the decisions prolonging his detention. The applicant made repeated applications for release on personal grounds, submitting that he had to secure the care and well‑being of his [DATE_TIME] son. He also contested the reasonableness of the charge against him, maintaining that it was solely based on evidence from his common-law wife who was his alleged accomplice.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) prolonged his detention until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] it ordered that he be kept in custody until [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] it extended that period until [DATE_TIME]. The court reiterated the grounds originally given for the applicant’s detention. It also considered that the need to take further evidence from experts justified the continuation of that measure.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant, together with his common-law wife, was indicted on charges of homicide, attempted homicide, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, uttering threats, theft, burglary, fraud and illegally possessing explosives and dangerous substances before the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court. In all, 24 charges were brought against the applicant. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 95 witnesses.\n\nThe Regional Court continually prolonged the applicant’s detention pending trial. On [DATE_TIME] it extended his detention until [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the trial court dismissed the applicant’s request of [DATE_TIME] to sever his case and assign it to a separate set of proceedings. It adjourned the hearing due to the absence of the co-defendant’s counsel.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant’s detention was prolonged on [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The court held that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid. It stressed the strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question.\n\nIn the meantime, on [DATE_TIME], the applicant had unsuccessfully challenged the composition of the court.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] he requested the trial court to appoint him a new legal aid counsel.\n\nOn 1 and [DATE_TIME] respectively he requested the trial court to assign his case to a separate set of proceedings. Subsequently, at the hearing held on [DATE_TIME] the applicant withdrew his motion.\n\nThe hearings scheduled for [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] had to be adjourned due to the co-defendant’s absence. Two other hearings were adjourned due to the absence of the judge rapporteur.\n\nThe trial court held further hearings: on [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. In the meantime, the hearings listed for [DATE_TIME] were cancelled due to the illness of the judge.\n\nSubsequently, as the length of the applicant’s detention reached the statutory time-limit of [DATE_TIME] laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ([PERSON] postępowania karnego), the Regional Court made 4 applications to the Katowice Court of Appeal ([PERSON]), asking for the applicant’s detention to be prolonged beyond that term. The Court of Appeal granted those applications on [DATE_TIME] (extending the applicant’s detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (extending his detention until [DATE_TIME]), on [DATE_TIME] (prolonging that term until [DATE_TIME]) and on [DATE_TIME] (ordering his continued detention until [DATE_TIME]). In all those decisions the Court of Appeal considered that the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention were still valid.\n\nThe applicant’s numerous applications for release and his appeals against the detention decisions were to no avail.\n\n[DATE_TIME], the trial court listed 10 hearings. The applicant and his lawyer were present at all the hearings. During this period the applicant on several occasions refused to participate in the trial, on two occasions he challenged the composition of the court. He also requested the court to appoint him a new legal aid counsel and applied for his case to be assigned to a separate set of proceedings. All his motions were dismissed. In the meantime, the hearing scheduled for [DATE_TIME] had been cancelled. The hearings listed for [DATE_TIME] had likewise been cancelled due to the illness of the judge.\n\nFurther hearings were held on 2, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant refused to participate in the hearing due to his illness. The trial court proceeded with taking evidence and ordered that an expert opinion on the applicant’s health be obtained.\n\nSubsequently, hearings were held on the following dates: [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. On [DATE_TIME] the trial court acknowledged the delay in the proceedings and stated that it was caused by the particular complexity of the case and other obstacles which could not have been removed by the relevant authorities.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for [DATE_TIME] had to be adjourned due to the applicant’s absence. Further hearings were held on: 8 and [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and 28 May, [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME]. The applicant and his counsel were present at the hearings. As of [DATE_TIME] the court had heard evidence from 85 witnesses.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the first‑instance judgment.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged a cassation appeal.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 8 December 1994 by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) and on 23 December 1994 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Government“), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 21928/93) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 31 March 1993 by a Pakistani national, Mr Abed Hussain. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention. The Commission further sought a decision as to whether there had been a breach of Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the case of Singh v. the United Kingdom (no. 56/1994/503/585) should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6) and that a joint hearing should be held. The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 January 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr N. Valticos, Mrs E. Palm, Mr F. Bigi and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 13 April 1995 and the applicant’s memorial on 18 April. The Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nIn accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 September 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr I. Christie, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr M. Shaw, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Mr H. Carter, Mr H. Bayne, Mr R. Harrington, Home Office, Advisers, (b) for the Commission Mr N. Bratza, Delegate, (c) for the applicant Mr E. Fitzgerald QC, Mr J. Cooper, Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, Ms K. Akester, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Pannick.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMr Abed Hussain was born in 1962 and is currently detained in Lindholme prison.\n\nOn 12 December 1978, the applicant - then aged 16 - was convicted at Leeds Crown Court of the murder of his younger brother, aged 2. The applicant had inflicted severe injuries on the infant while looking after him. He received a mandatory sentence of detention “during Her Majesty’s pleasure“ pursuant to section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) (see paragraph 23 below). Its effect was to render the applicant “liable to be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State [for the Home Department] may direct“.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on [DATE_TIME] by the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission“) and on [DATE_TIME] by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and [LOCATION] (“the Government“), within the [DATE_TIME] period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 21928/93) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on [DATE_TIME] by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON]. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and [DATE_TIME] (art. [DATE_TIME], art. 48) and to the declaration whereby [LOCATION] recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention. The Commission further sought a decision as to whether there had been a breach of Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the case of [PERSON] v. [LOCATION] (no. 56/[PHONE_NUMBER]) should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6) and that a joint hearing should be held. The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir [PERSON], the elected judge of [NRP] nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr [PERSON], the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On [DATE_TIME], in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], [PERSON], Mr [PERSON] and [PERSON] (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr [PERSON], acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and [DATE_TIME]). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on [DATE_TIME] and the applicant’s memorial on [DATE_TIME]. The Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nIn accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, [LOCATION], on [DATE_TIME]. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr [PERSON], Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr [PERSON] QC, [PERSON], Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON], Home Office, Advisers, (b) for the Commission Mr [PERSON], Delegate, (c) for the applicant Mr E. Fitzgerald QC, Mr [PERSON], Barrister-at-Law, Counsel, [PERSON], Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr [PERSON], Mr [PERSON] and Mr [PERSON].\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMr [PERSON] was born in [DATE_TIME] and is currently detained in Lindholme prison.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], the applicant - then aged 16 - was convicted at Leeds Crown Court of the murder of his younger brother, aged [DATE_TIME]. The applicant had inflicted severe injuries on the infant while looking after him. He received a mandatory sentence of detention “during Her Majesty’s pleasure“ pursuant to section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act [DATE_TIME] (as amended) (see paragraph 23 below). Its effect was to render the applicant “liable to be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State [for the Home Department] may direct“.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 7070/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Ms Burcu Ballıktaş (“the applicant”), on 3 January 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr Ercan Kanar, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been subjected to ill-treatment in a gendarmerie station and that the criminal proceedings subsequently brought against her had not been fair.\n\nOn 29 November 2007 the President of the Court's Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Ankara.\n\nOn 6 March 2000 the applicant was arrested by the gendarmerie in the border city of Edirne on her return from Bulgaria. She was detained in a gendarmerie station. According to an arrest report prepared by the gendarmerie the same day, the applicant was informed of her right to be represented by a lawyer and to inform her family about her arrest. Nevertheless, it was also stated in the same document that, if the offence in respect of which she was arrested fell within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts, she could consult a lawyer only if her detention period was extended by a judge or if a judge ordered her detention in a prison. The applicant signed the report and wrote on it that she had “no requests”.\n\nThe applicant was interrogated during her detention at the gendarmerie station, and an eight-page statement was taken from her between 7 and 9 March 2000. In her statement the applicant admitted to having engaged in activities on behalf of the PKK0.\n\nOn 9 March 2000 the applicant was examined by a doctor at the Edirne branch of the Forensic Medicine Directorate. According to the medical report drawn up the same day, there were “no injuries or signs of ill-treatment on her body”.\n\nThe same day she was brought before the prosecutor and then before the Edirne Magistrates' Court, which ordered her pre-trial detention in prison. In two statements made during meetings with the prosecutor and the judge the applicant admitted to being a member of the PKK.\n\nAccording to the three statements referred to above, the applicant did not want to be represented by a lawyer during the questioning.\n\nOn 3 April 2000 the prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant with that court for the offence of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK. The prosecutor, referring to the above-mentioned statements made by the applicant, alleged that the applicant had left Turkey in 1996 and had been taken to the PKK's training camp in Lavrion, Greece, where she had received training. Following her training she had obtained a false German passport in order to enter the Netherlands. During her time in Europe she had engaged in activities on behalf of the PKK in Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nCriminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the Istanbul State Security Court (hereafter “the trial court”). During the proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer.\n\nDuring the first hearing, which was held on 22 June 2000, the applicant rejected the allegations against her and alleged that, before she was brought before the prosecutor and the judge on 9 March 2000, she had been told by the gendarmes that if she did not accept the accusations before the judge and the prosecutor she would be taken back to the gendarmerie station and tortured again. That had been the reason she had accepted the accusations before the prosecutor and the judge. When asked by the trial court what she had to say about the medical report of 9 March 2000 in which it was stated that her body bore no signs of ill-treatment, the applicant replied that the medical report had been prepared before she was beaten up by gendarme officers and threatened with rape. She also alleged that she had been stripped naked by the gendarmes during her detention. The applicant further informed the trial court that the gendarmes had not asked her whether she wanted to be represented by a lawyer during the questioning.\n\nDuring the second hearing, which was held on 29 August 2000, the applicant submitted a handwritten letter to the trial court. In the letter she alleged, in particular, that while she was being detained in the gendarmerie station she had been insulted by gendarme officers, blindfolded, beaten up and drenched with water. Before being questioned she had been undressed and “they” had touched various parts of her body. Threats of rape and death, directed at her and her mother, had also been made.\n\nThe lawyer representing the applicant told the trial court that his client's questioning had been in breach of the applicable procedure and legislation and, as such, the statements taken from her constituted unlawfully obtained evidence which was not admissible in a court of law. Other than the statements taken from his client by the gendarmerie and then by the prosecutor and the judge on 9 March 2000, there was no evidence against her. The lawyer drew the trial court's attention to a Court of Cassation decision according to which confessions not supported by further evidence were not admissible as evidence.\n\nThe lawyer further asked the trial court to hear a “cassette of the questioning” of the applicant which had apparently been mentioned in a document drawn up by the gendarmerie. This request was rejected by the trial court which noted that the cassette was not in its possession.\n\nThe lawyer also pointed out that there was no mention of his client's name in the statements taken from E.Ş. who, according to the indictment, had helped his client to go to Greece.\n\nOn 9 October 2001 the applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to twelve years and six months' imprisonment. In convicting the applicant the trial court had regard to the statements taken from her at the gendarmerie station and then by the prosecutor and the judge on 9 March 2000, as well as to the statements made by E.Ş. in the course of his trial in 1998.\n\nThe applicant appealed against her conviction and argued, in particular, that the decision of the trial court had not been adequately reasoned. In the grounds of appeal the applicant's lawyer also repeated his earlier defence submissions concerning the allegedly unlawful nature of the evidence used in convicting his client, and referred to various Articles of the Convention.\n\nOn 8 July 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's conviction.\n\nAt the time notice of the application was given to the respondent Government, the Government were requested to submit to the Court a copy of the “cassette of questioning” referred to above (see paragraph 16 above). It appears from the documents submitted to the Court by the applicant that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Ministry of Justice to obtain the cassette so that it could be submitted to the Court. The gendarmerie, who were requested by the domestic judicial authorities to produce the cassette, stated in their letter of 21 May 2008 that they had “no records of the cassette being handed over to the Edirne prosecutor”.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 7070/03) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Ms Burcu Ballıktaş (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr [PERSON], a lawyer practising in [LOCATION]. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been subjected to ill-treatment in a gendarmerie station and that the criminal proceedings subsequently brought against her had not been fair.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Court's Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was arrested by the gendarmerie in the border city of [PERSON] on her return from [LOCATION]. She was detained in a gendarmerie station. According to an arrest report prepared by the gendarmerie [DATE_TIME], the applicant was informed of her right to be represented by a lawyer and to inform her family about her arrest. Nevertheless, it was also stated in the same document that, if the offence in respect of which she was arrested fell within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts, she could consult a lawyer only if her detention period was extended by a judge or if a judge ordered her detention in a prison. The applicant signed the report and wrote on it that she had “no requests”.\n\nThe applicant was interrogated during her detention at the gendarmerie station, and an eight-page statement was taken from her between 7 and 9 March 2000. In her statement the applicant admitted to having engaged in activities on behalf of the PKK0.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was examined by a doctor at the [PERSON] branch of the Forensic Medicine Directorate. According to the medical report drawn up [DATE_TIME], there were “no injuries or signs of ill-treatment on her body”.\n\n[DATE_TIME] she was brought before the prosecutor and then before the Edirne Magistrates' Court, which ordered her pre-trial detention in prison. In two statements made during meetings with the prosecutor and the judge the applicant admitted to being a member of the PKK.\n\nAccording to the three statements referred to above, the applicant did not want to be represented by a lawyer during the questioning.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant with that court for the offence of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK. The prosecutor, referring to the above-mentioned statements made by the applicant, alleged that the applicant had left [LOCATION] in [DATE_TIME] and had been taken to the PKK's training camp in [LOCATION], [LOCATION], where she had received training. Following her training she had obtained a false [NRP] passport in order to enter the [LOCATION]. During her time in [LOCATION] she had engaged in activities on behalf of the PKK in [LOCATION] and the [LOCATION].\n\nCriminal proceedings against the applicant commenced before the Istanbul State Security Court (hereafter “the trial court”). During the proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer.\n\nDuring the first hearing, which was held on [DATE_TIME], the applicant rejected the allegations against her and alleged that, before she was brought before the prosecutor and the judge on [DATE_TIME], she had been told by the gendarmes that if she did not accept the accusations before the judge and the prosecutor she would be taken back to the gendarmerie station and tortured again. That had been the reason she had accepted the accusations before the prosecutor and the judge. When asked by the trial court what she had to say about the medical report of [DATE_TIME] in which it was stated that her body bore no signs of ill-treatment, the applicant replied that the medical report had been prepared before she was beaten up by gendarme officers and threatened with rape. She also alleged that she had been stripped naked by the gendarmes during her detention. The applicant further informed the trial court that the gendarmes had not asked her whether she wanted to be represented by a lawyer during the questioning.\n\nDuring the second hearing, which was held on [DATE_TIME], the applicant submitted a handwritten letter to the trial court. In the letter she alleged, in particular, that while she was being detained in the gendarmerie station she had been insulted by gendarme officers, blindfolded, beaten up and drenched with water. Before being questioned she had been undressed and “they” had touched various parts of her body. Threats of rape and death, directed at her and her mother, had also been made.\n\nThe lawyer representing the applicant told the trial court that his client's questioning had been in breach of the applicable procedure and legislation and, as such, the statements taken from her constituted unlawfully obtained evidence which was not admissible in a court of law. Other than the statements taken from his client by the gendarmerie and then by the prosecutor and the judge on [DATE_TIME], there was no evidence against her. The lawyer drew the trial court's attention to a Court of Cassation decision according to which confessions not supported by further evidence were not admissible as evidence.\n\nThe lawyer further asked the trial court to hear a “cassette of the questioning” of the applicant which had apparently been mentioned in a document drawn up by the gendarmerie. This request was rejected by the trial court which noted that the cassette was not in its possession.\n\nThe lawyer also pointed out that there was no mention of his client's name in the statements taken from E.Ş. who, according to the indictment, had helped his client to go to [LOCATION].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] imprisonment. In convicting the applicant the trial court had regard to the statements taken from her at the gendarmerie station and then by the prosecutor and the judge on [DATE_TIME], as well as to the statements made by E.Ş. in the course of his trial in [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe applicant appealed against her conviction and argued, in particular, that the decision of the trial court had not been adequately reasoned. In the grounds of appeal the applicant's lawyer also repeated his earlier defence submissions concerning the allegedly unlawful nature of the evidence used in convicting his client, and referred to various Articles of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's conviction.\n\nAt the time notice of the application was given to the respondent Government, the Government were requested to submit to the Court a copy of the “cassette of questioning” referred to above (see paragraph 16 above). It appears from the documents submitted to the Court by the applicant that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the Ministry of Justice to obtain the cassette so that it could be submitted to the Court. The gendarmerie, who were requested by the domestic judicial authorities to produce the cassette, stated in their letter of [DATE_TIME] that they had “no records of the cassette being handed over to the [PERSON] prosecutor”.",

    "text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 11118/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mr Wojciech Nowak (“the applicant”), on 13 March 2006.\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his son, which had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 17 November 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Zawiercie.\n\nIn 1993 the applicant married A.N. In 1994 they had a son, D. Subsequently, the applicant and A.N. separated. Since their separation, they have been living in the same town and in the same street.\n\nOn 3 September 1996 the Zawiercie District Court issued an interim contact order. According to its terms, the applicant was allowed to visit the child every Tuesday and every first Saturday and third Sunday of the month, between 4 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.\n\nBetween 29 September 1996 and 5 October 1997 the Zawiercie police intervened on 12 occasions in order to facilitate the applicant's contact with his child. These interventions took place at A.N's place of residence and it would appear that on all these occasions the applicant was able to see the child.\n\nOn 27 May 1997 the Katowice Regional Court dissolved the applicant's marriage. It awarded parental rights to A.N., limited the applicant in the exercise of his rights and ordered that D.'s permanent residence be with his mother. The applicant was allowed to participate in decisions about the child's education and health.\n\nOn 1 September 1997, 5 May 1998 and 18 May 1999 the applicant made applications for fines to be imposed on A.N. under Article 1051 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He subsequently withdrew the applications.\n\nOn 4 March 1998 the District Court modified the access arrangements to allow the applicant to take his son for two weeks' holiday between 1 and 15 July.\n\nBetween 1 June 1998 and 28 January 1999 the Zawiercie police intervened on nine occasions in order to facilitate the applicant's contact with D. It appears that only on one of these occasions was the applicant unable to see D., as the child stated that he had not wished to see his father.\n\nOn 15 April 1999, on the applicant's motion, the Zawiercie District Court ordered A.N to allow the applicant's contact with the child on pain of a 100 PLN fine.\n\nBetween 18 April 1999 and 8 June 1999 the police intervened on eight occasions in order to enforce the applicant's contacts with his son.\n\nOn 9 December 1999 the applicant and his ex-wife concluded a court settlement concerning the applicant's visiting right. According to its terms the contacts were to be enforced under supervision of a court appointed guardian in order to protect D.'s well-being.\n\nHowever, the mother failed to comply with the access arrangements. On 5 January 2000 the applicant asked the Zawiercie District Court to impose a fine on A.N. for failure to comply with the settlement. On 9 March 2000 the District Court ordered A.N. to make the child available for a visit (by 1 May 2000), on pain of having to pay a fine.\n\nOn 28 April 2000 the applicant lodged yet another request for a fine to be imposed on A.N. On 19 December 2000 the District Court dismissed that request. The court obtained reports from two experts including a psychologist and heard evidence from several witnesses. It considered that A.N had not turned the child against his father. It noted that the child had not wished to attend the meetings with his father. Moreover, because of the forced contacts, in particular the two-week holiday in 1998, D. started suffering from anxiety and fear. The court also made reference to the fact that the applicant had proposed not to have any contacts with the child for 5 years if A.N did not claim maintenance payments for that period. The applicant's further appeal was dismissed by the Katowice Regional Court on 28 February 2001.\n\nMeanwhile, on 21 February 2000 the applicant filed a motion for amendment of the divorce decree in the part relating to parental rights. On 18 October 2000 the Zawiercie District Court dismissed his application.\n\nThe applicant appealed, and on 28 December 2000 the Katowice Regional Court gave a decision granting custody to the applicant and ordering that D.'s permanent residence be with his father. The mother was allowed to participate in decisions concerning the child's education and choice of profession.\n\nOn 29 December 2000 A.N. filed an application with the Zawiercie District Court to be granted sole custody of D.\n\nOn 23 August 2001 the District Court returned the applicant's request to impose a fine on A.N. since he had failed to pay the required court fee. His subsequent interlocutory appeal was dismissed on 15 November 2001.\n\nOn 12 October 2001 the Zawiercie District Court modified the decision of 28 December 2000. The court held that A.N. should be granted full custody over D. and that D.'s place of residence should be with his mother. The applicant was allowed to decide jointly about the child's education and choice of profession.\n\nA further appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the Czestochowa Regional Court on 19 December 2001. The court held that the applicant had not had a good relationship with his child and that the boy was afraid of him. The court stressed that the applicant could not have successfully claimed custody over D. since his son fled from him whenever he had seen him.\n\nMeanwhile, the applicant asked the court to hand D. over to him. On 27 June 2001 the District Court gave an interim decision and held that while the custody proceedings were pending the child should stay with his mother. On 31 January 2002 the District Court refused to hand D. over to the applicant.\n\nOn 15 March 2002 the Zawiercie District Court dismissed the applicant's motion to impose a fine on A.N. for obstructing his access to the child.\n\nOn 6 October 2005 the applicant again requested that D. be restored to him. On 14 October 2005 the Zawiercie District Court refused his request. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nOn 16 December 2005 the applicant filed an application to be granted full parental rights. His application was dismissed by the Zawiercie District Court on 28 July 2006. The court held that D. had been living with his mother, with whom he had very close relations, and it was in the child's best interest to leave him with her. The court referred to the child's (then 12 years old) own statements that his mother had not obstructed his contact with the applicant. It was D. himself who had avoided contact with his father. The court further noted that between 2001 and 2005 (when A.N filed a claim for increase of maintenance payments) the applicant had not attempted to contact his son and to exercise his visiting rights. Their contact was limited to occasional meetings on the street, since they lived nearby. The applicant's appeal against this decision was dismissed on 27 September 2006 by the Czestochowa Regional Court.\n\nOn 24 March 2006 the applicant asked the court to impose a fine on the mother for obstructing his contacts with D. On 22 June 2006 the District Court dismissed his request. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.",

    "presidio_anonymized_text": "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 11118/06) against [LOCATION] lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a [NRP] national, Mr [PERSON] (“the applicant”), on [DATE_TIME].\n\nThe Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr [PERSON] of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the [NRP] authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his son, which had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in [DATE_TIME] and lives in [LOCATION].\n\nIn [DATE_TIME] the applicant married [PERSON] In [DATE_TIME] they had a son, [NRP] Subsequently, the applicant and A.N. separated. Since their separation, they have been living in the same town and in the same street.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Zawiercie District Court issued an interim contact order. According to its terms, the applicant was allowed to visit the child [DATE_TIME] and every first Saturday and third Sunday of the month, [DATE_TIME]\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] police intervened on 12 occasions in order to facilitate the applicant's contact with his child. These interventions took place at A.N's place of residence and it would appear that on all these occasions the applicant was able to see the child.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court dissolved the applicant's marriage. It awarded parental rights to A.N., limited the applicant in the exercise of his rights and ordered that [NRP]'s permanent residence be with his mother. The applicant was allowed to participate in decisions about the child's education and health.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], [DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the applicant made applications for fines to be imposed on A.N. under Article 1051 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He subsequently withdrew the applications.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court modified the access arrangements to allow the applicant to take his son for [DATE_TIME] holiday [DATE_TIME].\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the [LOCATION] police intervened on nine occasions in order to facilitate the applicant's contact with [NRP] It appears that only on one of these occasions was the applicant unable to see [NRP], as the child stated that he had not wished to see his father.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME], on the applicant's motion, the Zawiercie District Court ordered A.N to allow the applicant's contact with the child on pain of a 100 PLN fine.\n\n[DATE_TIME] and [DATE_TIME] the police intervened on eight occasions in order to enforce the applicant's contacts with his son.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant and his ex-wife concluded a court settlement concerning the applicant's visiting right. According to its terms the contacts were to be enforced under supervision of a court appointed guardian in order to protect [NRP]'s well-being.\n\nHowever, the mother failed to comply with the access arrangements. On [DATE_TIME] the applicant asked the Zawiercie District Court to impose a fine on A.N. for failure to comply with the settlement. On [DATE_TIME] the District Court ordered A.N. to make the child available for a visit (by [DATE_TIME]), on pain of having to pay a fine.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant lodged yet another request for a fine to be imposed on A.N. On [DATE_TIME] the District Court dismissed that request. The court obtained reports from two experts including a psychologist and heard evidence from several witnesses. It considered that A.N had not turned the child against his father. It noted that the child had not wished to attend the meetings with his father. Moreover, because of the forced contacts, in particular the [DATE_TIME] holiday in [DATE_TIME], [NRP] started suffering from anxiety and fear. The court also made reference to the fact that the applicant had proposed not to have any contacts with the child for [DATE_TIME] if A.N did not claim maintenance payments for that period. The applicant's further appeal was dismissed by the Katowice Regional Court on [DATE_TIME].\n\nMeanwhile, on [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed a motion for amendment of the divorce decree in the part relating to parental rights. On [DATE_TIME] the Zawiercie District Court dismissed his application.\n\nThe applicant appealed, and on [DATE_TIME] the Katowice Regional Court gave a decision granting custody to the applicant and ordering that [NRP]'s permanent residence be with his father. The mother was allowed to participate in decisions concerning the child's education and choice of profession.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] A.N. filed an application with the Zawiercie District Court to be granted sole custody of [NRP]\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the District Court returned the applicant's request to impose a fine on A.N. since he had failed to pay the required court fee. His subsequent interlocutory appeal was dismissed on [DATE_TIME].\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Zawiercie District Court modified the decision of [DATE_TIME]. The court held that A.N. should be granted full custody over [NRP] and that [NRP]'s place of residence should be with his mother. The applicant was allowed to decide jointly about the child's education and choice of profession.\n\nA further appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the Czestochowa Regional Court on [DATE_TIME]. The court held that the applicant had not had a good relationship with his child and that the boy was afraid of him. The court stressed that the applicant could not have successfully claimed custody over [NRP] since his son fled from him whenever he had seen him.\n\nMeanwhile, the applicant asked the court to hand [NRP] over to him. On [DATE_TIME] the District Court gave an interim decision and held that while the custody proceedings were pending the child should stay with his mother. On [DATE_TIME] the District Court refused to hand [NRP] over to the applicant.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the Zawiercie District Court dismissed the applicant's motion to impose a fine on A.N. for obstructing his access to the child.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant again requested that [NRP] be restored to him. On [DATE_TIME] the Zawiercie District Court refused his request. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.\n\nOn [DATE_TIME] the applicant filed an application to be granted full parental rights. His application was dismissed by the Zawiercie District Court on [DATE_TIME]. The court held that [NRP] had been living with his mother, with whom he had very close relations, and it was in the child's best interest to leave him with her. The court referred to the child's (then [DATE_TIME]) own statements that his mother had not obstructed his contact with the applicant. It was [NRP] himself who had avoided contact with his father. The court further noted that [DATE_TIME] (when A.N filed a claim for increase of maintenance payments) the applicant had not attempted to contact his son and to exercise his
