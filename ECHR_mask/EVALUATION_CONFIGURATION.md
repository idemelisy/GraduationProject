# ðŸ”§ PIRANHA EVALUATION CONFIGURATION SUMMARY

## ðŸ“‹ EVALUATION CONSTANTS & MAPPINGS

### **Label Mapping (PII_TO_GT)**
```python
PII_TO_GT = {
    'GIVENNAME': 'PERSON',      # Given names â†’ Person entities
    'SURNAME': 'PERSON',        # Surnames â†’ Person entities
    'CITY': 'LOC',             # Cities â†’ Location entities
    'BUILDINGNUM': 'LOC',      # Building numbers â†’ Location entities
    'STREET': 'LOC',           # Streets â†’ Location entities
    'ZIPCODE': 'LOC',          # Zip codes â†’ Location entities
    'DATEOFBIRTH': 'DATETIME'  # Date of birth â†’ Datetime entities
}
```

### **Cross-Domain Fairness - Ignored False Negatives**
```python
IGNORE_FN_LABELS = {
    "ORG",        # Organizations - domain-specific
    "DEM",        # Demographics - legal-specific titles
    "QUANTITY",   # Measurements - legal amounts
    "MISC",       # Miscellaneous - varied entities
    "CODE",       # Case numbers - legal codes
    "CASE",       # Legal case references
    "COURT",      # Court-specific entities
    "DATETIME"    # General datetime (except DATEOFBIRTHâ†’DATETIME matches)
}
```
**Rationale**: Piranha wasn't trained on legal domain entities, so missing them shouldn't count as failures.

### **Special Matching - Ignored False Positives**
```python
IGNORE_FP_LABELS = set()  # Currently empty - all FPs are evaluated
```

### **IoU Thresholds by Entity Type**
```python
IOI_THRESHOLDS = {
    "LOC": 0.3,      # More flexible for location boundaries
    "PERSON": 0.4,   # Moderate flexibility for person names
    "default": 0.5   # Standard threshold for other entities
}
```

### **Institutional Indicators for LOCâ†’ORG Matching**
```python
INSTITUTION_INDICATORS = [
    'court', 'byret', 'landsret', 'tribunal', 'hÃ¸jesteret', 'supreme',
    'prosecutor', 'district', 'police', 'department', 'ministry', 'office'
]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ EVALUATION PIPELINE OVERVIEW

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Load Piranha predictions and ground truth annotations
- Apply annotator filtering (use first available annotator)
- Normalize text and handle encoding issues

### **2. Label Harmonization** 
- Map Piranha labels to ground truth schema using PII_TO_GT
- Merge consecutive entities of same type
- Consolidate GIVENNAME + SURNAME â†’ PERSON

### **3. Matching Logic**
```
For each prediction:
â”œâ”€â”€ Try normal IoU-based matching with appropriate threshold
â”œâ”€â”€ If no match found â†’ Try special LOCâ†’ORG matching
â”œâ”€â”€ If special match found â†’ Mark as LOCâ†’ORG true positive
â””â”€â”€ If no match found â†’ Check overlap with existing matches before marking as FP
```

### **4. False Negative Processing**
```
For each ground truth entity:
â”œâ”€â”€ If not matched by any prediction
â”œâ”€â”€ Check if entity type is in IGNORE_FN_LABELS
â”œâ”€â”€ If not ignored â†’ Count as false negative
â””â”€â”€ If ignored â†’ Exclude from evaluation (fair cross-domain assessment)
```

### **5. False Positive Processing**
```
For each unmatched prediction:
â”œâ”€â”€ Check if significantly overlaps (â‰¥50%) with any matched ground truth
â”œâ”€â”€ If overlaps â†’ Don't count as false positive (avoid double penalty)
â”œâ”€â”€ If label in IGNORE_FP_LABELS â†’ Exclude from evaluation
â””â”€â”€ Otherwise â†’ Count as false positive
```

## ðŸ“Š SPECIAL MATCHING RULES

### **LOCâ†’ORG Special Matching**
**Conditions**:
1. Prediction label is "LOC" or "CITY"
2. Overlaps with ORG or DEM ground truth entity
3. Predicted text is contained within ground truth text
4. Predicted text length â‰¥ 3 characters
5. Predicted text is alphabetic (allowing spaces and hyphens)
6. Ground truth contains institutional indicators OR predicted text length â‰¥ 4

**Examples**:
- âœ… "Warsaw" in "Warsaw Regional Court"
- âœ… "KrakÃ³w" in "KrakÃ³w District Court" 
- âœ… "Copenhagen" in "Copenhagen City Court"

### **Overlap-Based FP Reduction**
**Conditions**:
1. Prediction is unmatched
2. Overlaps â‰¥50% with any already-matched ground truth entity
3. Prevents double-penalty for partial predictions of same entity

**Examples**:
- âœ… "February 1995" when " 13" already matched "13 February 1995"
- âœ… "Regional Court" when "Warsaw" already matched "Warsaw Regional Court"

### **DATETIME Special Handling**
**Logic**:
- DATEOFBIRTH predictions â†’ DATETIME ground truth = **True Positive**
- Missing DATETIME ground truth (not from DATEOFBIRTH) = **Ignored** (not False Negative)
- Pure DATETIME predictions â†’ DATETIME ground truth = **True Positive**

---

## ðŸ”¬ QUALITY ASSURANCE MEASURES

### **Duplicate Prevention**
- Each ground truth entity can only match one prediction
- Prevents inflated true positive counts from multiple partial matches

### **Boundary Tolerance**
- Allow Â±1 character difference in start/end positions
- Accounts for annotation inconsistencies and tokenization differences

### **Debug Capabilities**
- Detailed logging for problematic cases
- Case-specific debugging for Warsaw, KrakÃ³w examples
- Validation scripts for edge cases

### **Metrics Validation**
- Per-entity type breakdown
- Overall performance tracking
- Before/after improvement comparisons

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY EVALUATION PRINCIPLES

1. **Cross-Domain Fairness**: Don't penalize model for entity types it wasn't trained on
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Credit semantically correct predictions even with boundary differences
3. **Overlap Tolerance**: Avoid double penalties for partial overlapping predictions
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Recognize that legal text has specialized entities and language
5. **Methodological Rigor**: Systematic handling of edge cases and special scenarios
6. **Transparency**: Detailed logging and validation for all evaluation decisions

This configuration ensures fair, accurate, and comprehensive evaluation of Piranha's PII detection capabilities in the legal domain while maintaining methodological rigor and reproducibility.
